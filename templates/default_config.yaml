# TappsCodingAgents - Default Configuration Template
# 
# Recommended: run `tapps-agents init` (or `python -m tapps_agents.cli init`) to create
# `.tapps-agents/config.yaml` and install Cursor Rules, Skills, and workflow presets.
#
# If you want to copy manually, copy this file to `.tapps-agents/config.yaml` in your
# project root and customize as needed.

# Project metadata (optional)
