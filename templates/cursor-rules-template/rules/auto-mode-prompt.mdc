# Auto Mode with Prompt - Primary Use Case

## Overview

The primary use case for TappsCodingAgents is creating complete, tested applications from a description using fully automated workflows with timeline tracking.

## Short Command

```bash
python -m tapps_agents.cli create "Your project description here"
```

This is a shortcut for:
```bash
python -m tapps_agents.cli workflow full --auto --prompt "Your project description here"
```

## What It Does

1. **Fully Automated Execution**: Runs without any prompts or user interaction
2. **Requirements Gathering**: Passes your prompt to the analyst agent
3. **Complete SDLC Pipeline**: Executes all workflow steps (Analyst → Planner → Architect → Designer → Implementer → Reviewer → Tester → Ops → Documenter)
4. **Timeline Tracking**: Generates `project-timeline.md` showing:
   - Agent execution sequence
   - Start/end times for each agent
   - Duration for each step
   - Total workflow duration
   - Status summary

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
python -m tapps_agents.cli create "Create a task management web application"
```

### Detailed Description
```bash
python -m tapps_agents.cli create "Create a detailed interactive web application that is very modern and explains all the detailed information about this application. Contains a users guide, technical specs, technical designs, technical architecture and examples. Needs to be easy to use and a selling point to this application."
```

### With Different Workflow
```bash
python -m tapps_agents.cli create "Build a REST API for user management" --workflow rapid
```

## Natural Language Commands for Cursor

When the user says:
- "Create a web application for [description]"
- "Build a [project type] with [features]"
- "Create a new project for [description]"
- "Make a [application type] that [does something]"

Use the command:
```bash
python -m tapps_agents.cli create "[user's description]"
```

## Full Workflow Command (Alternative)

If the user wants more control:

```bash
python -m tapps_agents.cli workflow full --auto --prompt "Your description"
```

Options:
- `--auto`: Fully automated mode (no prompts)
- `--prompt` / `-p`: User description/prompt
- `--file`: Optional target file (for brownfield workflows)

## Output

After execution, you'll find:
- Complete application code
- Test files
- Documentation
- `project-timeline.md` - Execution timeline and metrics
- All artifacts from the SDLC pipeline

## When to Use

Use `create` command when:
- ✅ Starting a new project (greenfield)
- ✅ Building a complete application from scratch
- ✅ Need fully automated execution
- ✅ Want timeline tracking
- ✅ Need comprehensive documentation

Use regular `workflow` commands when:
- Working with existing codebases
- Need specific workflow (rapid, quality, fix, hotfix)
- Want to customize workflow execution

## Integration with Cursor AI

Cursor AI should recognize these patterns:
- "Create [something]" → Use `create` command
- "Build [something]" → Use `create` command
- "Make a [something]" → Use `create` command
- "Generate a [something]" → Use `create` command

The command will execute fully automated and produce a complete, tested application with timeline tracking.
