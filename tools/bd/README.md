Beads provides a persistent, structured memory for coding agents. It replaces messy markdown plans with a dependency-aware graph, allowing agents to handle long-horizon tasks without losing context.

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# Install (macOS/Linux/FreeBSD)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steveyegge/beads/main/scripts/install.sh | bash

# Initialize (Humans run this once)
bd init

# Tell your agent
echo "Use 'bd' for task tracking" >> AGENTS.md

```

## 🛠 Features

* **Git as Database:** Issues stored as JSONL in `.beads/`. Versioned, branched, and merged like code.
* **Agent-Optimized:** JSON output, dependency tracking, and auto-ready task detection.
* **Zero Conflict:** Hash-based IDs (`bd-a1b2`) prevent merge collisions in multi-agent/multi-branch workflows.
* **Invisible Infrastructure:** SQLite local cache for speed; background daemon for auto-sync.
* **Compaction:** Semantic "memory decay" summarizes old closed tasks to save context window.

## 📖 Essential Commands

| Command | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `bd ready` | List tasks with no open blockers. |
| `bd create "Title" -p 0` | Create a P0 task. |
| `bd dep add <child> <parent>` | Link tasks (blocks, related, parent-child). |
| `bd show <id>` | View task details and audit trail. |

## 🔗 Hierarchy & Workflow

Beads supports hierarchical IDs for epics:

* `bd-a3f8` (Epic)
* `bd-a3f8.1` (Task)
* `bd-a3f8.1.1` (Sub-task)

**Stealth Mode:** Run `bd init --stealth` to use Beads locally without committing files to the main repo. Perfect for personal use on shared projects.

## 📦 Installation

* **npm:** `npm install -g @beads/bd`
* **Homebrew:** `brew install steveyegge/beads/bd`
* **Go:** `go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest`
