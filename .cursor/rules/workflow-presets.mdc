# Workflow Presets - Quick Commands

## Overview

TappsCodingAgents provides preset workflows that can be executed with simple one-word commands. These workflows automatically orchestrate multiple agents to complete common SDLC tasks.

## Available Workflow Presets

### 1. Full SDLC Pipeline (`full` / `enterprise`)

**Command:** `python -m tapps_agents.cli workflow full`

**Best for:** Complete software development lifecycle with all quality gates

**Agent Sequence:**
1. Analyst - Gather Requirements
2. Planner - Create Stories
3. Architect - Design System
4. Designer - Api Design
5. Implementer - Write Code
6. Reviewer - Review Code
7. Tester - Write Tests
8. Ops - Security Scan
9. Documenter - Generate Docs
10. Orchestrator - Finalize

**Quality Gates:**
- Overall score: ≥70
- Security: ≥7.0
- Maintainability: ≥7.0

### 2. Fix (`fix` / `maintenance` / `hotfix` / `urgent` / `refactor` / `quick-fix`)

**Command:** `python -m tapps_agents.cli workflow fix`

**Best for:** Debug, fix, and verify issues in existing code

**Agent Sequence:**
1. Enhancer - Enhance Prompt
2. Debugger - Analyze Error
3. Implementer - Write Code
4. Reviewer - Review Code
5. Tester - Write Tests
6. Orchestrator - Finalize

**Quality Gates:**
- Overall score: ≥65
- Security: ≥6.5

### 3. Quality Improvement (`quality` / `improve`)

**Command:** `python -m tapps_agents.cli workflow quality`

**Best for:** Comprehensive code review and improvement cycle

**Agent Sequence:**
1. Reviewer - Review Code
2. Improver - Refactor
3. Reviewer - Review Code
4. Tester - Write Tests
5. Ops - Security Scan
6. Orchestrator - Finalize

**Quality Gates:**
- Overall score: ≥75
- Security: ≥7.5
- Maintainability: ≥8.0

### 4. Brownfield Project Analysis (`brownfield`)

**Command:** `python -m tapps_agents.cli workflow brownfield`

**Best for:** Comprehensive analysis workflow for existing codebases that provides:
- Project discovery and profiling
- Code quality assessment
- Architecture pattern analysis
- Codebase structure evaluation
- Technical debt categorization and prioritization
- Dependency and integration mapping
- Test and documentation coverage analysis
- Modernization roadmap generation

This workflow orchestrates multiple agents to provide a complete picture
of a brownfield project's current state and recommended improvements.

## Usage in Cursor AI

When working in Cursor AI, you can:

1. **Run workflows directly:**
   - Type: "Run rapid development workflow"
   - Or: "Execute full SDLC pipeline"
   - Or: "Start quality improvement"

2. **Use voice commands:**
   - "run rapid dev"
   - "execute enterprise workflow"
   - "start quick fix"

3. **Reference in conversations:**
   - "Use the rapid workflow for this feature"
   - "This needs the full enterprise workflow"
   - "Run the quality improvement cycle"

## When to Use Each Workflow

- **Complete software development lifecycle with all quality gates** → `workflow full`
- **Debug, fix, and verify issues in existing code** → `workflow fix`
- **Comprehensive code review and improvement cycle** → `workflow quality`
- **Comprehensive analysis workflow for existing codebases that provides:
- Project discovery and profiling
- Code quality assessment
- Architecture pattern analysis
- Codebase structure evaluation
- Technical debt categorization and prioritization
- Dependency and integration mapping
- Test and documentation coverage analysis
- Modernization roadmap generation

This workflow orchestrates multiple agents to provide a complete picture
of a brownfield project's current state and recommended improvements** → `workflow brownfield`

## Integration

These workflows integrate with:
- ✅ Expert consultation (domain experts)
- ✅ Quality gates (scoring thresholds)
- ✅ Context tiers (token optimization)
- ✅ Multi-agent orchestration
- ✅ Git worktree isolation

## List All Presets

```bash
python -m tapps_agents.cli workflow list
```

## Customization

Workflow presets are defined in `workflows/presets/`:
- `full-sdlc.yaml`
- `fix.yaml`
- `quality.yaml`
- `brownfield-analysis.yaml`

You can modify these files or create your own presets.
