Instead of making live calls to sources for each request, we proactively handle critical steps like data extraction, normalization, company enrichment, and quality assurance. This process guarantees both high-quality data and fast response times.\n\nTo guarantee the highest possible quality of data, we follow this process:\n\nContent acquisition\nWe continuously crawl different data sources, such as job boards, ATSs, and company websites. The frequency of our scrapers varies, with some running as often as every 10 minutes and others hourly, to ensure our data is always up-to-date.\n\nMore details:\n* [Jobs from 16,000 different websites](/en/docs/data/job/sources)\n* [Data freshness and scraping frequency](/en/docs/data/job/freshness)\n\nExtraction & Normalization\nFor every job we collect, we extract key entities including the job posting, company, and, when available, the hiring manager.\n\nWe also identify and extract technologies mentioned in the job title, description, and URL, then index them to enable filtering by tech stack.\n\nTo ensure data quality and consistency across the platform, we normalize all extracted fields. For example:\n\n* Job descriptions are converted into standardized Markdown format.\n* Locations are structured into city, state, country, and other geographic components.\n* Job titles are cleaned to remove special characters and extra whitespace.\n* Company industries are harmonized across different data sources.\n\nAdditionally, media assets such as company logos are downloaded and stored in our own infrastructure, allowing you to access them reliably via stable URLs for use in your own applications.\n\nJob deduplication\nMost companies use an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) to manage their hiring process. ATSs help streamline the candidate lifecycle, power career pages listing open roles, and sync job postings with major job boards like LinkedIn and Indeed.\n\nWhen a company posts a job through an ATS, it's common for that listing to appear on multiple job boards simultaneously. As a result, a single position may end up with 3\u20135 different references across various platforms. Additionally, job boards often scrape and repost listings from each other, further increasing duplication.\n\nJob posting deduplication is a crucial step to avoid having the same job posted multiple times in our database. If you use our data as sales signal, you wont' trigger the same signal multiple times. If you use our data to build a job board, you wont' have the same job posted multiple times.\n\nWe apply both algorithmic techniques and manual checks to eliminate duplicates effectively.\n```\n\n## TheirStack Credits Overview\n\n```APIDOC\nCredits:\n  Types:\n    - Company Credits: Used for revealing company details, accessing jobs, technologies, and firmographics.
