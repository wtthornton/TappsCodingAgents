    "content": "## YouTrack JavaScript API: Field Manipulation Methods\n\n```APIDOC\nIssue Field Operations:\n\nLegacy MPS-based API:\n  X.required\n  X.changed\n  X.becomes\n  X.oldValue\n\nJavaScript API:\n  issue.fields.required(ctx.X, <message>)\n  issue.fields.isChanged(ctx.X)\n  issue.fields.becomes(ctx.X, <ctx.X.value>)\n  issue.fields.oldValue(ctx.X)\n\nDescription: Keywords related to field validation and state (like required, changed, becomes, oldValue) are now implemented as methods on the `issue.fields` object, requiring context (`ctx`) and specific arguments.\n```\n\n## YouTrack JavaScript API: Global Keywords and Warnings\n\n```APIDOC\nGlobal Keywords and Warnings:\n\nLegacy MPS-based API:\n  message\n  assert\n  loggedInUser\n  now\n\nJavaScript API:\n  workflow.message(<message>) (from '@jetbrains/youtrack-scripting-api/workflow')\n  workflow.check(<condition>, <message>) (from '@jetbrains/youtrack-scripting-api/workflow')\n  ctx.currentUser\n  Date.now() (standard JS date API)\n\nDescription: Global constructs like message display, assertion checks, current user access, and timestamp retrieval have been updated to use JavaScript standards or specific YouTrack workflow API modules.\n```\n\n## Build Entity Methods\n\n```APIDOC\nBuild Entity Methods:\n\nfindByExtensionProperties(extensionPropertiesQuery)\n  Searches for Build entities with extension properties that match the specified query.\n  Available since 2024.3.43260\n  Parameters:\n    extensionPropertiesQuery: Object | The extension properties query, defined as a set of key-value pairs representing properties and their corresponding values.\n  Return Value:\n    Set.<Build> | The set of Build entities that contain the specified extension properties.\n  Example:\n    {\n    property1: \"value1\",\n    property2: \"value2\"\n    }\n\nbecomes(fieldName, expected)\n  Checks whether a field is set to an expected value in the current transaction.\n  Parameters:\n    fieldName: string | The name of the field to check.\n    expected: string | The expected value.\n  Return Value:\n    boolean | If the field is set to the expected value, returns `true`.\n\ncanBeReadBy(fieldName, user)\n  Checks whether a user has permission to read the field.\n  Parameters:\n    fieldName: string | The name of the field.\n    user: User | The user for whom the permission to read the field is checked.\n  Return Value:\n    boolean | If the user can read the field, returns `true`.\n\ncanBeWrittenBy(fieldName, user)\n  Checks whether a user has permission to update the field.\n  Parameters:\n    fieldName: string | The name of the field.\n    user: User | The user for whom the permission to update the field is checked.\n  Return Value:\n    boolean | If the user can update the field, returns `true`.\n\nis(fieldName, expected)\n  Checks whether a field is equal to an expected value.\n  Available since 2019.2.55603\n  Parameters:\n    fieldName: string | The name of the field to check.\n    expected: string | The expected value.\n  Return Value:\n    boolean | If the field is equal to the expected value, returns `true`.\n```\n\n## YouTrack Scripting API: Issue Event Handling and Fields\n\n```APIDOC\nentities.Issue.onChange(options)\n  - Registers a rule that executes when an issue is changed.\n  - Parameters:\n    - options: An object containing rule configuration.\n      - title: (string) A descriptive title for the rule.\n      - guard: (function(ctx): boolean) A function that determines if the rule should run. Receives a context object.\n      - action: (function(ctx): void) The function executed when the guard returns true. Receives a context object.\n      - requirements: (object) Defines fields and links needed by the rule.\n\nctx (Context Object)\n  - Represents the current execution context for a workflow rule.\n  - Properties:\n    - issue: The issue object that triggered the rule.\n    - Subsystem: (EnumField) Represents the 'Subsystem' field (example).\n    - SubtaskOf: (IssueLinkPrototype) Defines the 'Subtask' link type.\n\nissue.links['parent for'].added\n  - Accesses issues added via the 'parent for' link type.\n  - Returns: A collection of issues.\n\nissue.fields.Subsystem\n  - Accesses the value of the 'Subsystem' field for the current issue.\n\nsubtask.project.isArchived\n  - Checks if the subtask's project is archived.\n\nsubtask.project.findFieldByName(fieldName)\n  - Finds a field within the subtask's project by its name.\n  - Returns: The field object or null.\n\nfield.findValueByName(valueName)\n  - Finds an enum value within a field by its name.\n  - Returns: The enum value object or null.\n\nsubtask.fields.Subsystem = value;\n  - Sets the 'Subsystem' field on the subtask.\n\nentities.EnumField.fieldType\n  - Specifies that a requirement is an enumeration field.\n\nentities.IssueLinkPrototype\n  - Defines a link type for workflow requirements.\n  - Properties:\n    - name: (string) The name of the link type (e.g., 'Subtask').\n    - outward: (string) The name of the link from the current issue's perspective (e.g., 'parent for').\n    - inward: (string) The name of the link from the related issue's perspective (e.g., 'subtask of').\n```\n\n## YouTrack JavaScript API: Property Access Changes\n\n```APIDOC\nIssue Property Access:\n\nLegacy MPS-based API:\n  issue.becomesResolved()\n  issue.becomesReported()\n  issue.getId()\n  issue.getUrl()\n\nJavaScript API:\n  issue.becomesResolved\n  issue.becomesReported\n  issue.id\n  issue.url\n\nDescription: In the JavaScript API, methods for accessing issue properties are often replaced by direct property access, simplifying syntax.\n```\n\n## YouTrack Swimlane Management Actions\n\n```APIDOC\nSwimlane Management Actions:\n\nUpdate Swimlane Issue:\n  Action: Open the issue in single issue view.\n  Details: The issue ID is a link that opens the issue in a new browser tab.\n  Action: Open the issue in view mode.\n  Details: Click the edit icon (pencil) to open the issue in view mode for updates, similar to opening a card.\n\nAdd New Swimlane:\n  Button: New swimlane button (in toolbar).\n  Process: Opens a dialog to enter summary and description for a new issue, which is then added as a swimlane.\n\nMove Swimlane to Backlog:\n  Action: Click the Backlog button (folder icon) to show the backlog.\n  Process: Drag the swimlane to the backlog.\n  Effect: Removes the swimlane from the board and returns the issue and its assigned cards to the backlog.\n```\n\n## YouTrack Swimlane Management Actions\n\n```APIDOC\nSwimlane Management Actions:\n\nUpdate Swimlane Issue:\n  Action: Open the issue in single issue view.\n  Details: The issue ID is a link that opens the issue in a new browser tab.\n  Action: Open the issue in view mode.\n  Details: Click the edit icon (pencil) to open the issue in view mode for updates, similar to opening a card.\n\nAdd New Swimlane:\n  Button: New swimlane button (in toolbar).\n  Process: Opens a dialog to enter summary and description for a new issue, which is then added as a swimlane.\n\nMove Swimlane to Backlog:\n  Action: Click the Backlog button (folder icon) to show the backlog.\n  Process: Drag the swimlane to the backlog.\n  Effect: Removes the swimlane from the board and returns the issue and its assigned cards to the backlog.\n```\n\n## YouTrack Integration Job Settings\n\n```APIDOC\nIntegration Settings:\n  Pull data from finished job: Determines if the integration listens for only successfully finished jobs, all jobs unless the job was canceled, or considers all every job.\n  Add GitHub Action ID to the set of values in a custom field:\n    Description: Determines which custom field is populated with build numbers in the integrated YouTrack project. Restricted to custom fields that store a `build` type. YouTrack stores pipeline IDs instead of build numbers. The value for the selected field is set automatically in any issue updated by the integration.\n    Sub-option: Include pipelines that don't reference any issues: Determines whether all pipelines are processed or only those that contain references to YouTrack issues. Affected by the 'Pull data from assembled build' setting.\n  Select which issues to update:\n    Update issues referenced in commit messages, branch names, or build comments that match the following search criteria: Determines how the integration handles issues with references. Use the query input field to filter out any issues with mentions. Ignored if the option to update issues referenced in commit messages is deselected.\n    Update any issue that matches the following search criteria: Determines which issues are assigned build numbers whether they contain issue references or not. Standard criteria: `State: Fixed State: Verified resolved date: ${prev.build.time} .. ${build.time}`. Ensures only issues resolved since the last successful build and the current build are considered. Ignored if this option is deselected.\n    Behavior: If both options are enabled, build numbers are assigned to issues meeting either condition. If neither is selected, no issues are assigned build numbers based on pipeline activity.\n  Update selected issues: Determines whether the integration applies changes to selected issues in addition to automatic build number assignment. When 'Apply a command' is enabled, enter a predefined command applied to all issues assigned build numbers. Use `${build}` variable to reference the pipeline ID. Example: `Subsystem Testing Test in build ${build}`.\n```\n\n## YouTrack Agile Board Command Execution\n\n```APIDOC\nBatch Card Updates:\n\n- Select Cards: Use `Space` or `Ctrl` + click to select multiple cards.\n- Open Command Dialog: Press `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `J` or start typing to open the Apply Command dialog.\n- Execute Commands: Enter commands to update selected cards (e.g., assign to a user, change state).\n- Reference: For a complete list of supported commands, see the [Command Reference](command-reference.html).\n```\n\n## YouTrack Workflow API Set Object Methods\n\n```APIDOC\nSet Object Operations:\n\n- Access: `first()`, `last()`, `get(index)`\n- Iteration: `entries()`, `values()`, `forEach(visitor)`\n- Search: `find(predicate)`, `has(value)`\n- Size: `isEmpty()`, `isNotEmpty()`, `size` property\n- Modification: `add(element)`, `delete(element)`, `clear()`\n- Changes: `added`, `deleted`, `isChanged` properties\n\nSee [Set](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/youtrack/devportal/?v1-Set) for detailed descriptions.\n```",
