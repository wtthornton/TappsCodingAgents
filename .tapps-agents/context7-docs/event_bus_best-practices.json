Use strategically for branding and keywords.\n  - Subtitle: 30 characters. Crucial for keyword inclusion and impact.\n  - Keywords Field: 100 characters. Input keywords without spaces, separated by commas.\n  - Description: Avoid keyword stuffing. Focus on compelling copy.\n  - Updates: App updates may trigger a re-review process.\n\nGoogle Play Store:\n  - Title Limit: 50 characters. Allows for more descriptive titles.\n  - Short Description: 80 characters. Essential for conversion and initial impression.\n\nGeneral ASO Considerations:\n  - Keyword Research: Identify high-volume, relevant keywords with achievable difficulty.\n  - Metadata Optimization: Craft compelling titles, subtitles, and descriptions.\n  - Visual Assets: Guide icon design, screenshot flows, and video creation.\n  - Conversion Rate Optimization: Analyze user drop-offs and test value propositions.\n  - Rating & Review Management: Encourage positive reviews and respond strategically.\n  - Performance Tracking: Monitor keyword rankings, conversion rates, and competitor benchmarks.\n```\n\n## Common Workflow Patterns\n\n```APIDOC\nCommonWorkflowPatterns:\n  1. Code Review Workflow:\n     - AI pre-reviews for style and obvious issues\n     - Human focuses on architecture and logic\n     - Automated testing gates\n     - Clear escalation criteria\n\n  2. Feature Development Workflow:\n     - AI generates boilerplate and tests\n     - Human designs architecture\n     - AI implements initial version\n```\n\n## Cost Optimization Strategies\n\n```APIDOC\nCost Optimization Strategies:\n\n- Model quantization for efficiency\n- Caching frequent predictions\n- Batch processing when possible\n- Using smaller models when appropriate\n- Implementing request throttling\n- Monitoring and optimizing API costs\n```\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\n```APIDOC\nPerformance Optimization:\n  - Implementing efficient caching strategies\n  - Optimizing database queries and connections\n  - Using connection pooling effectively\n  - Implementing lazy loading where appropriate\n  - Monitoring and optimizing memory usage\n  - Creating performance benchmarks\n```\n\n## Integration Patterns\n\n```APIDOC\nIntegration Patterns:\n\n- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)\n- Semantic search with embeddings\n- Multi-modal AI applications\n- Edge AI deployment strategies\n- Federated learning approaches\n- Online learning systems\n```\n\n## Performance Budget Template\n\n```APIDOC\n## Performance Budget: [App Name]\n\n### Page Load Budget\n- HTML: <15KB\n- CSS: <50KB\n- JavaScript: <200KB\n- Images: <500KB\n- Total: <1MB\n\n### Runtime Budget\n- LCP: <2.5s\n- TTI: <3.5s\n- FID: <100ms\n- API calls: <3 per page\n\n### Monitoring\n- Alert if LCP >3s\n- Alert if error rate >1%\n- Alert if API p95 >500ms\n```",
