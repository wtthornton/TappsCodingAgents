Access is valid for 90 days after reveal.\n    - API Credits: Used for running actions via the TheirStack API.\n  Usage:\n    - View credit usage by visiting the usage page: https://app.theirstack.com/settings/usage.\n  Plan Inclusion:\n    - Both credit types are included in free trial and subscription plans. The amount varies based on the TheirStack plan.\n```\n\n## Inferring Tech Stack Data from Job Postings\n\n```APIDOC\nInferring Tech Stack Data:\n  Source: Job postings worldwide.\n  Methodology:\n    - Track company websites, job boards, and hiring platforms.\n    - Infer technology usage from mentions in job listings.\n  Mention Locations:\n    - Title: e.g., \"Senior React Developer\", \"Java Developer\", \"Odoo Developer\"\n    - Description: e.g., \"experience with Hubspot\", \"use GraphQL\", \"experience with React\"\n    - Job URL: e.g., ATS domains like \"join.com\", \"workable.com\"\n  Data Points for Technology Usage:\n    - Confidence Score (high, medium, low): Likelihood of technology usage.\n    - First date found: Date of the first job mention.\n    - Last date found: Date of the most recent job mention.\n    - Rel. occurrence: Frequency compared to similar technologies.\n    - N. jobs mentioned: Count of jobs mentioning the technology, with links.\n    - Category: Classification of the technology.\n```\n\n## TheirStack vs. Wappalyzer: Decision Guide\n\n```APIDOC\nQuick Decision Guide:\n\nChoose TheirStack if:\n  - You need to know which companies are using internal tools like CRMs, ERPs, databases, programming languages, etc.\n  - You want real-time notifications when companies adopt new technologies.\n  - You're looking for technographic data to power your sales and marketing efforts.\n\nChoose Wappalyzer if:\n  - You need to identify the technology stack of specific websites.\n  - You want to monitor changes in website technologies.\n  - You're interested in browser-based technology profiling.\n```\n\n## API Credit Usage and Webhook Costs\n\n```APIDOC\nWhat happens when I run out of API credits?\n  When you run out of API credits, webhook event monitoring is temporarily paused. Monitoring automatically resumes once you purchase additional API credits. Whether you miss events during the pause depends on your search criteria.\n\nHow much cost to run a webhook?\n  Webhook events are billed at the same rate as API requests. They consume 1 API credit per event.\n```\n\n## TheirStack API for Clay Integration\n\n```APIDOC\nTheirStack API Integration with Clay:\n\n1.  **New Jobs or Companies Table in Clay (Live Sync/One-Time Export)**:\n    *   **Action**: Create a new table in Clay.\n    *   **Source**: Monitor webhook.\n    *   **TheirStack Setup**: Configure a webhook in TheirStack to send data to Clay.\n    *   **Clay Setup**: Follow Clay's Webhook Guide for integration.\n    *   **Use Cases**: List jobs by keyword/location, list companies by technology stack (e.g., Snowflake, Python, AI, Cloud).\n\n2.  **Adding a New Column to Clay Table (Manual Sync)**:\n    *   **Action**: Add a new column to an existing Clay table.\n    *   **Clay Feature**: Use the \"HTTP API\" column type.\n    *   **TheirStack API Call**: Configure the HTTP API column in Clay to call TheirStack's API.\n    *   **Use Cases**: Add company's developer job count (last 30 days), \"Yes\"/\"No\" for specific technologies (e.g., Snowflake, Hubspot), or technology categories (e.g., AI, Cloud).\n    *   **Reference**: Review TheirStack API documentation at https://api.theirstack.com/\n\n3.  **Manual Export/Import**:\n    *   **Method**: Export data as CSV from TheirStack and manually upload it to Clay.\n    *   **Use Case**: Suitable for one-time data imports or when automated sync is not required.\n```\n\n## Company Technology Usage API\n\n```APIDOC\nAPI: TheirStack Company Technology Lookup\n\nEndpoint: /technology/{technology}\nDescription: Retrieves a list of companies that use a specific technology.\nParameters:\n  - technology (string, required): The name of the technology to search for (e.g., 'react', 'aws').\n\nResponse Structure (Example):\n{\n  \"n_companies\": 15000,\n  \"companies\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Example Corp\",\n      \"industry\": \"Software\",\n      \"size\": \"100-500 employees\",\n      \"location\": \"USA\",\n      \"funding\": \"$50M\",\n      \"revenue\": \"$10M - $50M\"\n    },\n    // ... more companies\n  ]\n}\n\nEndpoint: /technology/{technology}/country/{country}\nDescription: Retrieves a list of companies that use a specific technology within a given country.\nParameters:\n  - technology (string, required): The name of the technology to search for.\n  - country (string, required): The country to filter by (e.g., 'usa', 'germany').\n\nResponse Structure (Example):\n{\n  \"n_companies\": 500,\n  \"companies\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Example GmbH\",\n      \"industry\": \"Manufacturing\",\n      \"size\": \"50-200 employees\",\n      \"location\": \"Germany\",\n      \"funding\": \"$20M\",\n      \"revenue\": \"$5M - $25M\"\n    },\n    // ... more companies\n  ]\n}\n\nData Enrichment:\n- Industry classification\n- Organizational size\n- Geographical location\n- Funding rounds\n- Revenue figures\n\nData Source: Job postings analyzed from millions of companies.\nUpdate Frequency: Daily.\n```\n\n## Company Technology Usage API\n\n```APIDOC\nAPI: TheirStack Company Technology Lookup\n\nEndpoint: /technology/{technology}\nDescription: Retrieves a list of companies that use a specific technology.\nParameters:\n  - technology (string, required): The name of the technology to search for (e.g., 'react', 'aws').\n\nResponse Structure (Example):\n{\n  \"n_companies\": 15000,\n  \"companies\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Example Corp\",\n      \"industry\": \"Software\",\n      \"size\": \"100-500 employees\",\n      \"location\": \"USA\",\n      \"funding\": \"$50M\",\n      \"revenue\": \"$10M - $50M\"\n    },\n    // ... more companies\n  ]\n}\n\nEndpoint: /technology/{technology}/country/{country}\nDescription: Retrieves a list of companies that use a specific technology within a given country.\nParameters:\n  - technology (string, required): The name of the technology to search for.\n  - country (string, required): The country to filter by (e.g., 'usa', 'germany').\n\nResponse Structure (Example):\n{\n  \"n_companies\": 500,\n  \"companies\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Example GmbH\",\n      \"industry\": \"Manufacturing\",\n      \"size\": \"50-200 employees\",\n      \"location\": \"Germany\",\n      \"funding\": \"$20M\",\n      \"revenue\": \"$5M - $25M\"\n    },\n    // ... more companies\n  ]\n}\n\nData Enrichment:\n- Industry classification\n- Organizational size\n- Geographical location\n- Funding rounds\n- Revenue figures\n\nData Source: Job postings analyzed from millions of companies.\nUpdate Frequency: Daily.\n```\n\n## Common HTTP Header Fields\n\n```APIDOC\nCommon HTTP Headers:\n\nAuthorization:\n  - Purpose: Used for authentication to verify the client's identity.\n  - Example: Authorization: Bearer <token>\n\nContent-Type:\n  - Purpose: Specifies the format of the data being sent in the request body.\n  - Example (within Clay): Content-Type: application/json\n```",
