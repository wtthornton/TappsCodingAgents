    "content": "## Handling Duplicate Headers in Bulk Data Insertion Files\n\n```text\nIf a column header is duplicated in a file, we will mark the file as invalid and return an error response and note the duplicate column. Keep in mind that column headers are case-insensitive, so providing \"Column1\" and \"column1\" as 2 separate columns will be interpreted as duplicate and result in an invalid file. Also remember that column headers are separate from querystring fields. It is possible to send in a value in a column that is duplicated as a querystring field. In such case, the column value will be used.\n```\n\n## File Uploaded: Rows Skipped Due to Inconsistent Column Count\n\n```json\n{\n\"file_id\":\"3ae262c5-cdea-4bdb-a41c-fbd2c2004c4d\",\n  ...\n\"status_code\":\"UPLOADED\",\n\"processing_log\":\"On row: 1, inconsistent column count.
