processes. Therefore, the `function` needs to be serialized (pickled) and send to the other Python processes; `lambda`s cannot be pickled. Instead you can probably use `functools.partial` to accomplish what you want to do.\n```\n\n## Adaptive Learner Methods\n\n```Python\ndef ask(self, n: int, tell_pending: bool = True) -> tuple[list[int], list[Float]]:\n        points = list(range(self.n_requested, self.n_requested + n))\n\n        if any(p in self.data or p in self.pending_points for p in points):\n            # This means some of the points `< self.n_requested` do not exist.\n            points = list(\n                set(range(self.n_requested + n))\n                - set(self.data)\n                - set(self.pending_points)\n            )[:n]\n\n        loss_improvements = [self._loss_improvement(n) / n] * n\n        if tell_pending:\n            for p in points:\n                self.tell_pending(p)\n        return points, loss_improvements\n\ndef tell(self, n: Int, value: Real) -> None:\n        if n in self.data:\n            # The point has already been added before.\n            return\n\n        self.data[n] = value\n        self.pending_points.discard(n)\n        self.sum_f += value\n        self.sum_f_sq += value**2\n        self.npoints += 1\n\ndef tell_pending(self, n: int) -> None:\n        self.pending_points.add(n)\n\ndef remove_unfinished(self):\n\"\"\"Remove uncomputed data from the learner.\"\"\"\n        self.pending_points = set()\n```\n",
