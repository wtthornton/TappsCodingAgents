# AGENTS.md

This file is the main context for AI coding agents working on this project. For TappsCodingAgents users, see `.cursor/rules/` for workflow and quality rules, `.tapps-agents/config.yaml` for configuration, and `tapps-agents --help` for commands.

This file helps AI coding agents work on this project. It follows the [AGENTS.md open format](https://agents.md/)—a standard place for context and instructions that any coding agent (Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Aider, etc.) can use.

**Project:** {{PROJECT_NAME}}

**Tech stack (detected):** {{TECH_STACK_SUMMARY}}

## Setup commands

- Install dependencies: `{{INSTALL_CMD}}`
- Run tests: `{{TEST_CMD}}`
- Lint / format: `{{LINT_CMD}}`

Adjust the commands above to match your project (e.g. `pip install -e .`, `pnpm install`, `npm ci`).

## Testing instructions

- Tests live in `tests/` (or your project’s test directory). Run the test command before committing.
- Fix any test or type errors until the suite is green.
- Add or update tests for the code you change when adding or changing behavior.

## Project structure

- `src/` or project root – Application source code
- `tests/` – Unit and integration tests
- `docs/` – Documentation (if present)
- `.tapps-agents/` – TappsCodingAgents config, experts, and workflow state (if using TappsCodingAgents)

## Code style

- Follow the project’s existing style and conventions.
- Use the project’s linter and formatter (see Lint command above); fix reported issues before committing.

## Git / PR workflow

- Run tests (and lint if applicable) before committing.
- Use clear commit messages and PR titles.

## Boundaries

- **Always:** Run tests before committing; follow existing code style; keep secrets out of code and commits.
- **Ask first:** Large refactors, new dependencies, schema or config changes, deployment-related changes.
- **Never:** Commit secrets, API keys, or credentials; modify production config or secrets; delete critical project files without confirmation.

## TappsCodingAgents (optional)

This project can use [TappsCodingAgents](https://pypi.org/project/tapps-agents/) for workflow agents and Cursor integration. If installed and initialized (`tapps-agents init`):

- Prefer `@simple-mode *build "description"` for new features.
- Use `@simple-mode *fix <file> "description"` for bug fixes and `@simple-mode *review <file>` for code review.
- See `.cursor/rules/` and `tapps-agents --help` for full commands and workflows.
