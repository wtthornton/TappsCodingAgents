# Git Workflow Rules

## Commit Format

- Use clear, imperative subject lines (e.g. "Add auth endpoint", "Fix null check in validator")
- Optionally include scope: `feat(auth): add login endpoint`
- Keep the body concise when needed; reference issues or PRs

## Branching for Agent Workflows

- **`*build` and `*full`**: when `human_oversight.branch_for_agent_changes` is true, work runs on `tapps-agents/build-{workflow_id}`; merge to main only after human review
- **`*fix`**: typically on a short-lived branch or main, depending on project policy
- Use `checkpoints_before_steps` (e.g. before implementer, designer) to review before large changes

## PR Flow

- Run `@simple-mode *review` on changed files before opening a PR
- Use `@simple-mode *pr {title}` to generate PR description and quality summary
- Ensure tests pass and quality gates meet thresholds (e.g. overall ≥70, security ≥6.5)
