# Project Context (User Project)

Read **AGENTS.md** at the project root first for:
- Project context, setup commands, and boundaries
- Build, test, and lint commands
- Code style and Git/PR workflow

Use **`.cursor/rules/`** for workflow and quality rules and **`tapps-agents`** CLI or **@simple-mode** for workflows (e.g. `@simple-mode *build "description"`, `@simple-mode *review <file>`).

See `tapps-agents --help` and the command reference in `.cursor/rules/` for full options.
