# TappsCodingAgents Project Context

## Important: Dual Nature of This Project

**This project has TWO distinct roles:**

### 1. Framework Development (Primary Role)
**TappsCodingAgents is a framework** that provides:
- 13 workflow agents (analyst, planner, architect, implementer, tester, reviewer, etc.)
- Industry Experts system
- Model Abstraction Layer (MAL)
- Code quality analysis tools
- Workflow orchestration

**When working on framework development:**
- You're modifying the framework code itself (`tapps_agents/` package)
- You're adding new agents, features, or capabilities
- You're fixing bugs or improving the framework
- Focus on: `tapps_agents/`, `tests/`, `requirements/`, `docs/`

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Framework Changes MUST Use Full SDLC Workflow**

When modifying the TappsCodingAgents framework itself, you **MUST** use Simple Mode Full SDLC workflow:

```bash
# CLI
tapps-agents simple-mode full --prompt "Implement [enhancement description]" --auto

# Or in Cursor chat
@simple-mode *full "Implement [enhancement description]"
```

**Why?** The full SDLC workflow ensures:
- ✅ Proper requirements analysis (analyst)
- ✅ Architecture design (architect)
- ✅ Quality gates with automatic loopbacks (reviewer)
- ✅ Test generation and execution (tester)
- ✅ Security validation (ops)
- ✅ Complete documentation (documenter)
- ✅ Full traceability (requirements → stories → architecture → implementation)

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Directly implement code without using the workflow
- ❌ Skip planning, design, or architecture phases
- ❌ Validate only afterward (use quality gates during development)
- ❌ Skip test generation (tests should be part of workflow)

**Example:**
```
❌ WRONG: Directly implement Context7 enhancements
✅ CORRECT: @simple-mode *full "Implement Context7 automatic integration enhancements"
```

### 2. Self-Hosting (Secondary Role)
**TappsCodingAgents uses its own framework** for its own development:
- Configuration: `.tapps-agents/` directory
- 5 Industry Experts configured (AI frameworks, code quality, architecture, DevOps, documentation)
- Enhancer Agent used for prompt enhancement
- Context7 integration for library documentation

**When working on self-hosted development:**
- You're using the framework to develop the framework itself
- You're using agents via CLI or Python API
- You're configuring experts and knowledge bases
- Focus on: `.tapps-agents/`, `workflows/`, project-specific tasks

## Context Awareness

**When AI assistants work in this project, they should:**

1. **Understand the dual context:**
   - Framework code (`tapps_agents/`) = developing the framework
   - Project configuration (`.tapps-agents/`) = using the framework

2. **Distinguish between:**
   - **Framework users**: People who install and use TappsCodingAgents in their projects
   - **Framework developers**: People working on TappsCodingAgents itself (us)

3. **Documentation clarity:**
   - User-facing docs should focus on "how to use the framework"
   - Developer docs should focus on "how to develop the framework"
   - Self-hosting docs should explain "how we use our own framework"

## Current Self-Hosting Configuration

**Version**: 2.0.0 (self-hosting)

**Configured Experts:**
- `expert-ai-frameworks` - AI agent orchestration, workflow management
- `expert-code-quality` - Static analysis, code scoring, quality metrics
- `expert-software-architecture` - System design patterns, architecture decisions
- `expert-devops` - CI/CD integration, testing strategies, deployment
- `expert-documentation` - Technical documentation, knowledge bases

**Active Usage:**
- Enhancer Agent: 23+ enhancement sessions in `.tapps-agents/sessions/`
- Context7: KB cache in `.tapps-agents/kb/context7-cache/`
- Workflows: `workflows/prompt-enhancement.yaml`

## Guidelines for AI Assistants

1. **When asked about "using TappsCodingAgents":**
   - Explain how to use the framework in a user's project
   - Reference user-facing documentation (QUICK_START.md, DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md)
   - Show CLI and Python API examples

2. **When asked about "developing TappsCodingAgents":**
   - Explain how to modify the framework code
   - Reference developer documentation (ARCHITECTURE.md, API.md)
   - Show how to add agents, extend functionality

3. **When asked about "this project's setup":**
   - Explain the self-hosting configuration
   - Reference `.tapps-agents/` configuration
   - Show how the framework is used internally

4. **Always clarify context:**
   - If unclear, ask: "Are you asking about using the framework or developing it?"
   - Provide examples for both contexts when relevant

## Examples

### Example 1: User Question
**Q: "How do I use the reviewer agent?"**
**A:** Explain CLI usage, Python API, configuration - focus on user perspective

### Example 2: Developer Question
**Q: "How do I add a new agent?"**
**A:** Explain framework architecture, BaseAgent class, agent registration - focus on development

### Example 3: Self-Hosting Question
**Q: "What experts are configured in this project?"**
**A:** Explain `.tapps-agents/experts.yaml`, the 5 experts, how they're used internally
