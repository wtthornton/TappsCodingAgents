# Simple Mode - Natural Language Interface

## Overview

Simple Mode provides a simplified interface for TappsCodingAgents that hides complexity while showcasing power. Use natural language commands instead of agent-specific syntax.

## How It Works

Simple Mode uses intent-based orchestration:

1. **Intent Parser**: Analyzes your natural language command
2. **Orchestrator Selection**: Routes to appropriate orchestrator (Build, Review, Fix, Test)
3. **Agent Coordination**: Coordinates multiple agents in sequence
4. **Result Formatting**: Presents results in user-friendly format

## Natural Language Commands

### Build Commands

Build new features using natural language:

- "Build a user authentication feature"
- "Create a REST API for products"
- "Add login functionality"
- "Implement user registration"
- "Generate a payment processing module"

**Workflow:** Enhancer (Full Enhancement - 7 stages) → Planner → Architect → Designer → Implementer

The Enhancer performs comprehensive prompt enhancement through all 7 stages:
1. **Analysis** - Intent, domains, scope, workflow type
2. **Requirements** - Functional/NFR + Expert consultation
3. **Architecture** - Design patterns, technology recommendations
4. **Codebase Context** - Related files, existing patterns
5. **Quality Standards** - Security, testing, performance requirements
6. **Implementation Strategy** - Task breakdown, dependencies
7. **Synthesis** - Combined enhanced prompt

### Review Commands

Review code quality using natural language:

- "Review my authentication code"
- "Check the quality of auth.py"
- "Analyze the security of this file"
- "Score the code in service.py"
- "Audit the authentication module"

**Workflow:** Reviewer → Improver (if issues found)

### Fix Commands

Fix bugs and errors using natural language:

- "Fix the error in auth.py"
- "Debug the login issue"
- "Resolve the bug in service.py"
- "Repair the broken authentication"
- "Correct the validation error"

**Workflow:** Debugger → Implementer → Tester

### Test Commands

Generate tests using natural language:

- "Add tests for service.py"
- "Generate tests for auth.py"
- "Verify the authentication code"
- "Create test coverage for user.py"
- "Test the payment module"

**Workflow:** Tester

### Full Lifecycle Command

Run the complete development lifecycle with automatic quality loopbacks:

- `@simple-mode full` - Run full SDLC workflow with testing and development loopbacks
- `@simple-mode full --prompt "description"` - Run with a specific project description
- `@simple-mode full --auto` - Run in fully automated mode

**Workflow:** Requirements → Planning → Design → Implementation → Review → Testing → Security → Documentation

**Features:**
- Automatic loopbacks if code quality scores aren't good enough
- Test execution with retry logic
- Security validation with remediation
- Final quality review before completion

## Command Variations

Simple Mode understands many ways to express the same intent:

- **Build synonyms**: build, create, make, generate, add, implement, develop, write, new, feature
- **Review synonyms**: review, check, analyze, inspect, examine, score, quality, audit, assess, evaluate
- **Fix synonyms**: fix, repair, resolve, debug, error, bug, issue, problem, broken, correct
- **Test synonyms**: test, verify, validate, coverage, testing, tests

## Using Simple Mode in Cursor

### Via Simple Mode Skill

Use the `@simple-mode` skill for natural language commands:

```
@simple-mode Build a user authentication feature
@simple-mode Review my authentication code
@simple-mode Fix the error in auth.py
@simple-mode Add tests for service.py
```

### Direct Natural Language

In Cursor chat, you can also use natural language directly (if Simple Mode is enabled):

```
Build a user authentication feature
Review my authentication code
Fix the error in auth.py
Add tests for service.py
```

## Full Lifecycle Workflow

The `@simple-mode full` command runs a complete development lifecycle:

```
@simple-mode full --prompt "Build a REST API for a todo app"
```

This workflow includes:
1. **Requirements** - Gather and analyze requirements
2. **Planning** - Create user stories
3. **Design** - System architecture design
4. **API Design** - API contracts and specifications
5. **Implementation** - Code generation
6. **Review** - Code review with quality gates (loops back if score too low)
7. **Testing** - Test generation and execution (loops back if tests fail)
8. **Security** - Security scanning (loops back if issues found)
9. **Documentation** - Generate documentation
10. **Final Review** - Final quality check before completion

The workflow automatically retries and improves code until quality thresholds are met.

## Advanced Options

To reveal advanced agent-specific commands:

- `@simple-mode *show-advanced` - Show advanced options
- `@simple-mode *help` - Show Simple Mode help
- `@simple-mode *status` - Check Simple Mode status

## Progression

Simple Mode supports progressive disclosure:

- **Beginner** (default): Intent-based commands only
- **Intermediate** (after 10 commands): Agent-specific commands revealed
- **Advanced** (after 50+ commands): Full agent control

## Configuration

Simple Mode can be configured in `.tapps-agents/config.yaml`:

```yaml
simple_mode:
  enabled: true
  auto_detect: true
  show_advanced: false
  natural_language: true
```

Toggle Simple Mode:
- `tapps-agents simple-mode on` - Enable
- `tapps-agents simple-mode off` - Disable
- `tapps-agents simple-mode status` - Check status

## Integration with Other Skills

Simple Mode works alongside other agent skills:

- You can still use `@reviewer *review` for advanced review options
- You can still use `@implementer *implement` for direct code generation
- Simple Mode is a convenience layer, not a replacement
