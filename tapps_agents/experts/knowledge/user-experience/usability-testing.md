- Confusion points
- Error-prone areas
- Friction points
- Pain points

### Validate Designs
- Test assumptions
- Validate concepts
- Measure success
- Confirm solutions
- Verify improvements

### Gather Insights
- User behavior
- User preferences
- User needs
- User expectations
- User feedback

## Testing Methods

### Moderated Testing
- Facilitator present
- Real-time guidance
- Immediate follow-up
