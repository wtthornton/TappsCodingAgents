# HIPAA Compliance

## Overview

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a US federal law that establishes privacy and security standards for protected health information (PHI). HIPAA applies to covered entities (healthcare providers, health plans, healthcare clearinghouses) and their business associates.

## Key Components

### Privacy Rule
- Establishes standards for protecting PHI
- Defines permitted uses and disclosures
- Grants individuals rights over their health information
- Requires administrative safeguards

### Security Rule
- Establishes security standards for ePHI
- Requires administrative, physical, and technical safeguards
- Applies to electronic protected health information
- Requires risk analysis and risk management

### Breach Notification Rule
- Requires notification of breaches of unsecured PHI
- Notification to individuals, HHS, and media (if applicable)
- Timely notification requirements

## Protected Health Information (PHI)
