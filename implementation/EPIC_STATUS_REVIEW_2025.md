## Recommendations

1. **EPIC_16 Implementation:** Begin implementation of Custom Skills Support. All story files are ready and well-structured.

2. **Story File Consistency:** Some story files exist for different epics with the same numbers (e.g., 7.1-7.5 for Documentation Polish vs 7.1-7.10 for Background Agent Auto-Execution). This is acceptable as they're for different epics, but consider using different numbering schemes if possible.

3. **Documentation:** All completed epics have comprehensive implementation summaries. Consider creating a master index of all epic documentation.

4. **Testing:** Verify that all "Completed" epics have corresponding test coverage as claimed in their implementation summaries.
