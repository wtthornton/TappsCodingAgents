# Auto-Execution Fix Summary

## Status: Deprecated

**Note**: This document is deprecated. Background Agents have been completely removed from the framework. Workflows now use direct execution via Cursor Skills only.

The `--auto` flag now controls automated workflow execution without user prompts, using direct execution instead of Background Agents.
