# Documentation Archive

This directory holds **historical documentation** that is no longer part of the active docs index. Current behavior and user-facing guides are in the main [Documentation Index](../README.md).

## Structure

| Directory | Contents |
|-----------|----------|
| **completed-improvements/** | Implementation summaries, phase completions, and "X_IMPLEMENTED" / "X_COMPLETE" docs. Current behavior is in CONFIGURATION, ARCHITECTURE, and user guides. |
| **feedback/** | Session feedback, retros, completion summaries, and improvement plans. Outcomes are reflected in project-critical docs or code. |
| **planning/** | Superseded roadmaps and plans. Active planning lives in `docs/planning/` or `docs/prd/`. |
| **epics/** | Epic-specific api/architecture/enhancement docs for closed epics. |
| **stories/** | Archived user-story artifacts. |
| *(root)* | Legacy archive files (cleanup summaries, repo analysis). |

## When to Use the Archive

- **Finding historical context:** Why a feature was implemented, what was tried, session notes.
- **Audit trail:** Implementation records and phase completion reports.

For **current** setup, workflows, configuration, and architecture, use [docs/README.md](../README.md).
