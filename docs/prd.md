# PRD (BMAD Standard Path)

BMAD expects a PRD at `docs/prd.md`.

In **this** repository, the “PRD” is maintained as a **sharded set of epics** under `docs/prd/`, plus the story backlog under `docs/stories/`.

## Canonical Sources (this repo)

- **Epics / roadmap**: `docs/prd/`
- **Stories (implementation backlog)**: `docs/stories/`
- **Project context**: `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`
- **Architecture**: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (also mirrored at `docs/architecture.md` for BMAD compatibility)

## Notes

- If you’re using BMAD sharding, this file is intentionally a thin index that points at the sharded sources-of-truth.
