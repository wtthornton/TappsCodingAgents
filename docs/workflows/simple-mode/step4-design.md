# Step 4 — Design (content design)

## Documentation design principles

- **Progressive disclosure**
  - Put the “80% path” near the top of docs
  - Move edge cases / advanced details lower with headings
- **Copy-pasteable snippets**
  - Provide small `.mdc` frontmatter examples and skill frontmatter examples
- **Low ambiguity**
  - Use checklists for “what good looks like”
  - Provide a “common mistakes” section for rules and skills

## Deliverables

- `docs/CURSOR_RULES_SETUP.md`: Add a short section on rule layering/scoping
- `docs/CUSTOM_SKILLS_GUIDE.md`: Add skill checklist + recommended layout + progressive disclosure note
