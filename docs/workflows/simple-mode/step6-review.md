# Step 6 — Review (what we’ll check)

## Review checklist

- **Consistency**
  - Terminology matches existing Cursor-first docs (rules vs skills)
  - No mention of Codex as a dependency or requirement
- **Practicality**
  - Examples use repo-real paths and conventions:
    - `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`
    - `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- **No duplication**
  - Avoid re-stating large blocks already present in `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`
  - Prefer links to existing docs where appropriate
