# Story 1.4: Composite Gating Model Implementation

<!-- Source: docs/prd/epic-1-sdlc-quality-engine.md -->
<!-- Context: SDLC Quality Engine Improvements - Gating Enhancement -->

## Status

**Deferred** - Duplicate of Story 27.4

## Story

**As a** SDLC workflow system,
**I want** gates to evaluate composite conditions (issues + verification outcomes) instead of just numeric scores,
**so that** the SDLC can make intelligent pass/fail decisions based on actual quality metrics rather than arbitrary thresholds.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Score-only gates replaced with composite gate logic
2. Hard fail conditions implemented (critical issues, verification failures, missing artifacts)
3. Soft fail/loopback conditions implemented (high issues above threshold, regression vs baseline, low expert confidence)
4. Configurable thresholds and gate policies added
5. Gates correctly evaluate composite conditions
6. Hard fails block pipeline execution
7. Soft fails trigger loopback protocol
8. Thresholds are configurable per workflow/project

## Dev Notes

**Integration Points:**
- Workflow executor: `tapps_agents/workflow/executor.py`
- Issues Manifest: Story 1.1 output
- Verification system: Story 1.3 output
- Project profile: `tapps_agents/core/project_profile.py`
- Loopback protocol: Story 1.5 (dependency)

**Technology Stack:**
- Python 3.13+
- Existing workflow state management
- Configuration system (YAML-based)

**Key Constraints:**
- Must maintain backward compatibility with score-based gates (gradual migration)
- Gate evaluation must be deterministic
- Configuration must support per-workflow and per-project overrides
- Must integrate with existing checkpoint/resume system

**Testing Standards:**
- Test file location: `tests/unit/test_composite_gates.py`
- Test gate evaluation logic
- Test configuration system
- Integration tests with workflow executor
