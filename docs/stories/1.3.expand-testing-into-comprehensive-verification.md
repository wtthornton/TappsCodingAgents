# Story 1.3: Expand Testing into Comprehensive Verification

<!-- Source: docs/prd/epic-1-sdlc-quality-engine.md -->
<!-- Context: SDLC Quality Engine Improvements - Verification Expansion -->

## Status

**Deferred** - Duplicate of Story 27.3

## Story

**As a** SDLC workflow system,
**I want** verification to encompass all quality checks (tests, linters, security scans, etc.) not just unit tests,
**so that** the SDLC can detect and report issues across all quality dimensions before declaring success.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Verification expanded beyond unit tests to include: build/compile/package checks, integration tests, static analysis (linters/type checks), dependency audit, security scans, policy checks, artifact integrity checks
2. Verification orchestrator created that runs appropriate checks based on project stack
3. Verification results integrated into Issues Manifest format
4. Verification runs all applicable checks for detected stack
5. Results properly categorized in Issues Manifest
6. Stack-specific checks correctly selected

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Design Verification Categories (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Define verification category taxonomy
  - [ ] Map categories to Issues Manifest categories
  - [ ] Document verification check types
  - [ ] Create verification check interface

- [ ] Task 2: Implement Verification Orchestrator (AC: 2, 6)
  - [ ] Create verification orchestrator class
  - [ ] Implement check selection based on project stack
  - [ ] Add check execution coordination
  - [ ] Implement parallel check execution where possible
  - [ ] Add check result aggregation

- [ ] Task 3: Implement Verification Checks (AC: 1, 4)
  - [ ] Build/compile/package check implementation
  - [ ] Integration test runner integration
  - [ ] Static analysis (linter/type checker) integration
  - [ ] Dependency audit check
  - [ ] Security scan integration
  - [ ] Policy check implementation
  - [ ] Artifact integrity check

- [ ] Task 4: Integrate with Issues Manifest (AC: 3, 5)
  - [ ] Convert verification results to Issues Manifest format
  - [ ] Categorize issues by verification type
  - [ ] Add verification metadata to issues
  - [ ] Create verification summary report

- [ ] Task 5: Testing & Validation (AC: 4, 5, 6)
  - [ ] Unit tests for verification orchestrator
  - [ ] Integration tests with different project stacks
  - [ ] Test check selection logic
  - [ ] Validate Issues Manifest integration

## Dev Notes

**Integration Points:**
- Validation layer: Story 1.2 output
- Issues Manifest: Story 1.1 output
- Project profile: `tapps_agents/core/project_profile.py`
- Existing test infrastructure: `tapps_agents/agents/tester/`

**Technology Stack:**
- Python 3.13+
- Existing test runners and linters
- Security scanning tools (bandit, safety, etc.)
- Dependency audit tools

**Key Constraints:**
- Verification checks must be non-blocking where possible
- Results must integrate with Issues Manifest schema
- Check selection must be efficient and accurate
- Must support extensible check plugins

**Testing Standards:**
- Test file location: `tests/unit/test_verification.py`
- Test with multiple project types
- Validate check selection accuracy
- Test Issues Manifest integration
