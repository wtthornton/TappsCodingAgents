# Story 16.4: Custom Skill Integration

<!-- Source: implementation/EPIC_16_Custom_Skills_Support.md -->

## Status

**Draft**

## Story

**As a** framework user,
**I want** custom Skills to integrate with framework agents and workflows,
**so that** my custom Skills can leverage all framework capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Custom Skill integration works with framework
2. Skill-to-agent mapping allows agents to use custom Skills
3. Skill workflow integration enables Skills in workflows
4. Skill context access provides framework features to Skills
5. Custom Skills work with all framework features

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Implement Skill-to-agent mapping (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create mapping system for Skills to agents
  - [ ] Allow agents to discover and use custom Skills
  - [ ] Integrate with agent system
  - [ ] Test agent access to custom Skills

- [ ] Task 2: Add Skill workflow integration (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Enable Skills in workflow definitions
  - [ ] Allow workflow steps to use custom Skills
  - [ ] Integrate with workflow executor
  - [ ] Test Skills in workflow execution

- [ ] Task 3: Implement Skill context access (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Provide framework context to Skills
  - [ ] Allow Skills to access framework features
  - [ ] Create context API for Skills
  - [ ] Document context usage

- [ ] Task 4: Integrate with framework features (AC: 1, 5)
  - [ ] Ensure Skills work with agent system
  - [ ] Ensure Skills work with workflow system
  - [ ] Ensure Skills work with other framework features
  - [ ] Test end-to-end integration

## Dev Notes

### Existing System Context

- Agents use Skills via Cursor interface
- Workflows can invoke Skills via `cursor_skill_helper.py`
- Framework features accessible to agents
- Integration patterns exist in framework

### Integration Approach

- Extend agent system to support custom Skills
- Extend workflow system to support custom Skills
- Create context provider for Skills
- Use existing integration patterns
- Maintain backward compatibility

### Technical Details

- **Integration Module**: `tapps_agents/core/skill_integration.py` (new)
- **Context Provider**: Provide framework context to Skills
- **Agent Integration**: Extend agent system for custom Skills
- **Workflow Integration**: Extend workflow executor for custom Skills
- **API**: Context API for Skills to access framework

### Risk Assessment

- **Primary risk**: Integration may break existing features
  - **Mitigation**: Maintain backward compatibility, test thoroughly
- **Primary risk**: Custom Skills may not work correctly
  - **Mitigation**: Validation, testing, clear documentation

### Rollback Plan

- Disable custom Skill integration
- Remove integration code
- Fall back to built-in Skills only

### Testing

- Test Skill-to-agent mapping
- Test Skill workflow integration
- Test context access
- Test end-to-end scenarios
- Test backward compatibility
