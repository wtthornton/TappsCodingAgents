# Story 24.1: Make `SECURITY.md` Real and Accurate

<!-- Source: implementation/cursor/EPIC_24_Security_Policy_Reality_And_Path_Enforcement.md -->
<!-- Context: Remove placeholders/contradictions and align security claims with actual behavior -->

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** maintainer and security reviewer,  
**I want** `SECURITY.md` to be accurate and free of placeholders,  
**so that** users have a credible, actionable security policy that matches the project’s real support and reporting process.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `SECURITY.md` contains **no placeholder values** (emails, version tables, links, or “TBD” policy text).
2. Supported versions guidance reflects the project’s **actual support policy** (or explicitly states “latest only” if that’s the reality).
3. The security contact mechanism is **real and usable** (e.g., GitHub Security Advisories), and the policy clearly states the preferred disclosure path.
4. Any statements about configuration/env-var substitution in security guidance match current implementation (or are explicitly documented as **not supported**).
5. Security/privacy documentation is internally consistent across:
   - `SECURITY.md`
   - `docs/CONTEXT7_SECURITY_PRIVACY.md`
   - `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` (where relevant)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Audit current security docs for placeholders and contradictions (AC: 1, 5)
  - [ ] Review `SECURITY.md`
  - [ ] Review `docs/CONTEXT7_SECURITY_PRIVACY.md`
  - [ ] Review `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` for claims about env-var substitution and secrets handling
  - [ ] Note any claims that cannot be verified in code

- [ ] Task 2: Update `SECURITY.md` to be real and consistent (AC: 1–4)
  - [ ] Replace/define supported versions policy
  - [ ] Confirm and document the actual disclosure channel (e.g., GitHub advisories only)
  - [ ] Remove or rewrite any claims that exceed current implementation
  - [ ] Ensure language is specific and testable (clear boundaries/assumptions)

- [ ] Task 3: Cross-doc alignment pass (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Update any referenced docs so terminology and policy statements match
  - [ ] Add cross-links between docs where appropriate

## Dev Notes

### Existing System Context

- Security documentation exists in `SECURITY.md`.
- Additional security/privacy guidance exists in `docs/CONTEXT7_SECURITY_PRIVACY.md` and config guidance in `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`.

### Integration Approach

- Prefer removing claims rather than “future promising”.
- Any mention of env-var substitution must match current config behavior (or state limitation explicitly).

### Risk Assessment

- **Risk**: Overstating security posture or publishing an unusable reporting channel.
- **Mitigation**: Keep policy minimal, verifiable, and aligned with GitHub-native disclosure workflow.

### Rollback Plan

- Documentation-only change: revert `SECURITY.md` edits if they inadvertently conflict with org policy.

### Testing

- Doc review check: ensure links work and policies are internally consistent.
