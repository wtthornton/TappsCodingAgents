# Story 1.6: Correlation IDs & Baseline Observability

<!-- Source: implementation/cursor/EPIC_01_Foundation.md -->
<!-- Context: Brownfield enhancement to improve debuggability and operability -->

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** developer/operator,
**I want** consistent correlation IDs and baseline structured logging for workflows/steps/messages,
**so that** I can trace failures and performance issues across multi-agent execution.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Workflow runs have a stable `workflow_id` that is propagated through state, step executions, and (when present) file-based messages.
2. Steps record `step_id`, `agent`, `action`, timing, and terminal status consistently (including failure errors).
3. Logs include correlation fields (at least `workflow_id`, `step_id`, `agent`) for workflow lifecycle events.
4. Logging does not leak secrets/PII (redaction rules documented).
5. Tests validate that correlation fields are present in persisted state artifacts.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Define correlation ID convention (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Confirm current workflow id format in `CursorWorkflowExecutor.start()` and `WorkflowExecutor.start()`
  - [ ] Define how `task_id` / `message_id` relate to `workflow_id`

- [ ] Task 2: Ensure state contains correlation fields everywhere (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Verify `WorkflowState.step_executions` is consistently populated (Cursor + headless paths)
  - [ ] Ensure error strings are captured for failed steps

- [ ] Task 3: Add baseline structured logging (AC: 3, 4)
  - [ ] Add a consistent logging adapter or helper to include correlation fields
  - [ ] Document redaction expectations and avoid logging raw secrets

- [ ] Task 4: Tests (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Unit tests that create a minimal workflow run and validate persisted state contains correlation fields

## Dev Notes

### Existing System Context

- Workflow state persistence exists under `.tapps-agents/workflow-state/` (see `tapps_agents/workflow/state_manager.py`).
- Cursor-mode executor sets `workflow_id` as `f"{workflow.id}-{timestamp}"` in `tapps_agents/workflow/cursor_executor.py`.

### Integration Approach

- Prefer minimal logging helper and keep using Python stdlib logging.
- Ensure correlation IDs are propagated into any new messaging artifacts created by Story 1.2.

### Risk Assessment

- **Primary risk**: log noise or accidental sensitive data exposure
- **Mitigation**: explicit redaction guidance + keep correlation fields small and consistent.

### Rollback Plan

- Revert logging helper changes; keep correlation IDs in state since they are low-risk.

### Testing

- Use `pytest`.
