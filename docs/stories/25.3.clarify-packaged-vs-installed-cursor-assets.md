# Story 25.3: Clarify packaged vs installed Cursor assets

<!-- Source: implementation/cursor/EPIC_25_Documentation_And_Contributor_Consistency.md -->
<!-- Context: Prevent confusion about what ships in this repo vs what `tapps-agents init` installs into target repos -->

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** user running `tapps-agents init`,  
**I want** docs to clearly explain which Cursor/Claude assets are shipped templates versus installed into my target repo,  
**so that** I understand where rules/skills/background-agents come from and where they should live after initialization.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Docs explicitly state that `tapps_agents/resources/...` contains shipped templates and that `tapps-agents init` installs into `.cursor/` and `.claude/skills/` in the target repo.
2. Default paths documented in `docs/CURRENT_DEFAULTS.md` match actual installer behavior and output paths.
3. Any docs that reference rules/skills/background-agents use consistent terminology for:
   - shipped templates (in this repo/package)
   - installed outputs (in the initialized repo)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Identify and document shipped resource locations (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Confirm shipped assets under `tapps_agents/resources/cursor/` and `tapps_agents/resources/claude/`
  - [ ] Document what each directory provides (rules, background agents config, skills)

- [ ] Task 2: Verify installer behavior and align docs (AC: 1–2)
  - [ ] Confirm where `tapps-agents init` writes rules/skills/background-agents in a target repo
  - [ ] Ensure `docs/CURRENT_DEFAULTS.md` reflects those defaults (paths + filenames)

- [ ] Task 3: Cross-doc consistency pass (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Update `README.md` and relevant guides to use consistent terms and paths
  - [ ] Remove any ambiguous references that blur shipped vs installed locations

## Dev Notes

### Existing System Context

- Cursor/Claude initialization assets exist under `tapps_agents/resources/*`.
- Docs reference `.cursor/` rules and `.claude/skills/` paths, but drift can create confusion.

### Integration Approach

- Treat the install step as a contract: docs should mirror what the CLI actually writes.
- Prefer explicit “shipped vs installed” language and a short table mapping source → destination.

### Risk Assessment

- **Risk**: Users may misplace assets, leading to Cursor/Claude not picking up rules/skills.
- **Mitigation**: Make destination paths explicit and include a quick verification checklist (e.g., “these files should exist after init”).

### Rollback Plan

- Revert doc wording changes if they introduce confusion; keep any verified path clarifications if they match installer behavior.

### Testing

- Run `tapps-agents init` into a clean target directory and confirm the docs match the created file/folder layout.
