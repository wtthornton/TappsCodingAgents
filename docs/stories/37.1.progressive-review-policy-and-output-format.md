# Story 37.1: Progressive Review Policy and Output Format

<!-- Source: docs/prd/epic-5-progressive-task-level-review.md -->
<!-- Context: Progressive Task-Level Review - Define decision model and standard output format -->

## Status

**✅ Implemented**

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-18

## Story

**As a** TappsCodingAgents autonomous agent executing a story task,  
**I want** an automated progressive review policy and output format,  
**so that** each task completion is backed by an automated decision (PASS / CONCERNS / BLOCK) and evidence without human intervention.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The progressive review decision schema is defined: PASS / CONCERNS / BLOCK.
2. Severity thresholds are defined, including what qualifies as “blocking” by default.
3. Required metadata for each task review is defined (story id, task identifier, timestamp/date, affected files, decision, severity notes).
4. The output format is stable, human-readable, and supports rollup into a final QA summary.
5. The policy explicitly defines “fix now vs defer” rules for CONCERNS and BLOCK decisions.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Define automated decision schema and severity policy (AC: 1, 2, 5)
  - [ ] Define what each decision means and when it is used
  - [ ] Define default blocking categories and examples
  - [ ] Define automated triggers for each decision (quality gates, test results, code scores)
- [ ] Task 2: Define required metadata and output structure (AC: 3, 4)
  - [ ] Define minimum required fields
  - [ ] Define where this record is referenced from the story (linking convention)
- [ ] Task 3: Define rollup expectations (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Define how multiple task reviews roll into final QA decision evidence

## Dev Notes

### Existing System Context

- BMAD progressive review workflow and validation rules exist in `.bmad-core/tasks/progressive-code-review.md` and `.bmad-core/PROGRESSIVE_REVIEW_VALIDATION.md`.
- This story defines policy/format only; storage conventions and workflow integration are handled in Stories 37.2 and 37.3.

## Testing

- Documentation-only change; no automated tests required.
- Validation approach: run the policy against 2–3 hypothetical tasks and confirm the decisions and metadata are sufficient for a final QA rollup.
