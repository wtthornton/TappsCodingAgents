## Dev Notes

### Existing System Context

- Agent definitions in `.claude/skills/`
- BMAD pattern in `.bmad-core/agents/`
- Template directory structure exists
- Agent IDs are defined

### Integration Approach

- Follow template directory patterns
- Use consistent naming
- Reference existing agent definitions
- Follow BMAD organization

### Risk Assessment

- **Primary risk**: Organization may be unclear
  - **Mitigation**: Clear naming, documentation, examples

### Rollback Plan

- Remove directory
- Role files optional
- No breaking changes

### Testing

- Verify directory structure
- Validate role files
- Test file organization
- Review organization clarity
