# Story 7.10: Testing and Documentation

<!-- Source: implementation/EPIC_07_Background_Agent_Auto_Execution.md -->

## Status

**Draft**

## Story

**As a** developer or user,
**I want** comprehensive tests and documentation for the auto-execution system,
**so that** I can confidently use the feature and understand how it works.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Comprehensive unit tests created for all auto-execution components (>80% coverage)
2. Integration tests created for workflow executor integration
3. End-to-end tests created for complete workflow execution
4. Test fixtures and mocks created for Background Agent simulation
5. User documentation written (setup guide, troubleshooting, examples)
6. Developer documentation written (architecture, API reference)
7. Troubleshooting guide created with common issues and solutions

## Dev Notes

### Existing System Context

- Test location: `tests/` directory
- Test framework: pytest (from `pytest.ini`)
- Test patterns: Follow existing test structure
- Documentation location: `docs/` directory
- Existing guides: `docs/BACKGROUND_AGENTS_GUIDE.md`, workflow guides

### Integration Approach

- Follow existing test patterns and structure
- Use pytest fixtures for test setup
- Create test utilities in `tests/utils/` or `tests/fixtures/`
- Integrate with existing test infrastructure
- Follow existing documentation patterns

### Technical Details

**Test Structure:**
- Unit tests: `tests/workflow/test_background_auto_execution_*.py`
- Integration tests: `tests/workflow/test_integration_auto_execution.py`
- End-to-end tests: `tests/workflow/test_e2e_auto_execution.py`
- Fixtures: `tests/fixtures/background_agent_fixtures.py`

**Test Coverage:**
- Target: >80% for new code
- Use `pytest-cov` for coverage reporting
- Focus on critical paths and error handling

**Documentation Structure:**
- User guide: `docs/BACKGROUND_AGENTS_AUTO_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md`
- Developer guide: `docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` (add section)
- API reference: `docs/API.md` (add section)
- Troubleshooting: Part of user guide or separate `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_AUTO_EXECUTION.md`

**Mock Components:**
- Mock Background Agent: Simulate command file reading and execution
- Mock status files: Generate test status files
- Mock worktrees: Create temporary worktrees for testing

### Risk Assessment

- **Primary risk**: Tests may not cover all edge cases
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test planning, code coverage requirements, review
- **Primary risk**: Documentation may become outdated
  - **Mitigation**: Keep docs close to code, review during PRs, version docs

### Rollback Plan

- Tests can be updated or disabled if needed
- Documentation updates are non-breaking

### Testing

- Test the tests: Verify test fixtures work correctly
- Test documentation: Verify examples work, links are valid
- Code coverage: Ensure >80% coverage achieved
- Documentation review: Ensure clarity and completeness
