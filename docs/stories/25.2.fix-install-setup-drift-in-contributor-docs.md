# Story 25.2: Fix install/setup drift in contributor docs

<!-- Source: implementation/cursor/EPIC_25_Documentation_And_Contributor_Consistency.md -->
<!-- Context: Remove stale/non-existent references and align contributor setup with the actual repo + CI installation method -->

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** contributor (especially on Windows),  
**I want** contributor setup/install documentation to reference real files and the same install method CI uses,  
**so that** I can get a working dev environment without guesswork or doc drift.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Contributor docs remove references to non-existent files or unused flows (e.g. `requirements-dev.txt` if not used).
2. The recommended install method matches CI (per Epic 21/23 alignment) and is consistently documented as the “one true workflow”.
3. Windows activation and command examples are correct and consistent across `README.md`, `docs/*`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Audit contributor setup docs for drift and broken references (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Review `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` setup sections
  - [ ] Identify any referenced files/paths that do not exist in the repo
  - [ ] Compare Windows examples across docs for consistency (PowerShell vs cmd, venv activation, paths)

- [ ] Task 2: Align install method to CI and make it canonical (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Identify the CI installation steps and the intended dependency policy
  - [ ] Update docs to recommend the same method (and demote/remove alternatives unless required)

- [ ] Task 3: Normalize Windows-specific instructions and examples (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Ensure venv creation/activation commands are correct for Windows PowerShell
  - [ ] Ensure path separators and command quoting are consistent and correct

## Dev Notes

### Existing System Context

- The repo contains multiple documentation entry points (`README.md`, `docs/*`) plus contributor guidance (`CONTRIBUTING.md`).
- CI expectations and dependency policy are addressed in related epics (notably Epic 21/23).

### Integration Approach

- Adopt “one true workflow” and make alternatives explicitly optional and clearly labeled.
- Remove stale references rather than carrying legacy, unverified instructions forward.

### Risk Assessment

- **Risk**: Tightening to one canonical flow could conflict with niche contributor preferences.
- **Mitigation**: Keep the canonical flow primary while allowing clearly-marked “advanced/alternate” notes only when they’re actively supported.

### Rollback Plan

- Revert doc edits if they inadvertently break the canonical onboarding path; keep any validated reference fixes.

### Testing

- Follow the updated docs on Windows in a clean checkout; ensure documented install steps match CI and successfully run lint/type/tests.
