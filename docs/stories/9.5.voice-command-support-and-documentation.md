# Story 9.5: Voice Command Support and Documentation

<!-- Source: implementation/EPIC_09_Natural_Language_Workflow_Triggers.md -->
<!-- Context: Brownfield enhancement - Voice command support and comprehensive documentation -->

## Status

**✅ Completed**

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-27

## Story

**As a** framework user,
**I want** voice command support and comprehensive documentation for natural language workflow commands,
**so that** I can use workflows via voice input (if supported) and understand all available natural language commands.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Voice command support is implemented (if Cursor supports voice input)
2. Voice-friendly workflow aliases are created (easy to pronounce, distinct)
3. Voice command parsing handles speech-to-text variations and errors
4. Comprehensive documentation is created covering all natural language commands
5. Documentation includes examples for each workflow type
6. Documentation includes troubleshooting guide for common issues
7. Documentation includes best practices for natural language commands
8. System gracefully degrades when voice input is not available (text input always works)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Investigate Cursor voice input support (AC: 1, 8)
  - [ ] Research Cursor voice input capabilities
  - [ ] Test voice input availability in Cursor chat
  - [ ] Document voice input requirements and limitations
  - [ ] Implement feature detection (check if voice available)

- [ ] Task 2: Create voice-friendly aliases (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Define voice-friendly aliases for each workflow
  - [ ] Ensure aliases are easy to pronounce and distinct
  - [ ] Test aliases for clarity and uniqueness
  - [ ] Integrate voice aliases into parser

- [ ] Task 3: Implement voice command parsing (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Handle speech-to-text variations (common mispronunciations)
  - [ ] Handle speech-to-text errors (fuzzy matching for voice input)
  - [ ] Normalize voice input (remove filler words, normalize case)
  - [ ] Integrate with existing natural language parser

- [ ] Task 4: Create comprehensive documentation (AC: 4, 5, 6, 7)
  - [ ] Document all natural language commands
  - [ ] Create examples for each workflow type
  - [ ] Write troubleshooting guide (common errors, solutions)
  - [ ] Document best practices (when to use natural language vs CLI)
  - [ ] Include voice command examples (if supported)

- [ ] Task 5: Create documentation structure (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create `docs/NATURAL_LANGUAGE_WORKFLOWS.md` guide
  - [ ] Include command reference table
  - [ ] Include examples section
  - [ ] Include troubleshooting section
  - [ ] Link from main README and workflow documentation

- [ ] Task 6: Test voice support (AC: 1, 3, 8)
  - [ ] Test voice input if available
  - [ ] Test graceful degradation when voice unavailable
  - [ ] Test voice command parsing accuracy
  - [ ] Document voice support status

## Dev Notes

### Existing System Context

- Natural language parser from Story 9.1 provides base parsing
- Intent detection from Story 9.2 provides intent recognition
- Workflow aliases exist in parser from Story 9.1
- Documentation exists in `docs/` directory
- Cursor chat interface may or may not support voice input

### Integration Approach

- Extend natural language parser with voice-specific handling
- Add voice-friendly aliases to existing alias system
- Create documentation following project documentation patterns
- Gracefully handle voice unavailability (text always works)
- Keep voice support as optional enhancement

### Risk Assessment

- **Primary risk**: Cursor may not support voice input
  - **Mitigation**: Graceful degradation, text input always works, voice as enhancement only
- **Primary risk**: Speech-to-text may have high error rates
  - **Mitigation**: Use fuzzy matching, confirm ambiguous commands, learn from corrections
- **Primary risk**: Voice aliases may conflict with text aliases
  - **Mitigation**: Separate voice alias namespace, prioritize text aliases, document conflicts

### Rollback Plan

- Voice support is optional, can be disabled
- Text input remains primary interface
- Documentation is additive, no breaking changes

### Testing

- Test voice input availability detection
- Test voice command parsing with various inputs
- Test graceful degradation when voice unavailable
- Test voice-friendly alias matching
- Review documentation for completeness and accuracy
- Test documentation examples
