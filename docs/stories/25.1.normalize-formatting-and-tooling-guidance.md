# Story 25.1: Normalize formatting and tooling guidance

<!-- Source: implementation/cursor/EPIC_25_Documentation_And_Contributor_Consistency.md -->
<!-- Context: Eliminate conflicting style rules/commands and align CONTRIBUTING guidance with configured tooling -->

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** contributor,  
**I want** formatting and tooling guidance to be consistent across docs and match the configured toolchain,  
**so that** I can follow a single set of commands and style rules without running into contradictions or CI surprises.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `CONTRIBUTING.md` line length guidance matches configured tooling behavior (ruff/black) and does not contradict other docs.
2. Formatter guidance is unified to a single recommended formatter approach (no competing guidance across `README.md`, `docs/*`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
3. All commands referenced for formatting/linting/type checking/testing are valid and reflect the current toolchain and repo configuration.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Inventory formatting/tooling guidance across docs (AC: 1–3)
  - [ ] Review `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `README.md`, and `docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` for style/tooling guidance
  - [ ] Note any conflicting line-length, formatter, or command recommendations

- [ ] Task 2: Confirm “source of truth” config and align guidance (AC: 1–3)
  - [ ] Verify configured formatting/linting settings in `pyproject.toml` (ruff/black settings) and any CI configs
  - [ ] Update docs to match the actual config (especially line length and formatter choice)

- [ ] Task 3: Validate commands and examples are runnable (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Ensure commands referenced in docs exist (entrypoints/scripts) and match current expected usage
  - [ ] Replace/remove any stale commands or flags

## Dev Notes

### Existing System Context

- The project uses a Python toolchain with ruff/black/mypy/pytest and documents setup in `README.md` and `docs/*`.
- Contributor guidance exists in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and is expected to align with CI behavior.

### Integration Approach

- Treat documentation as a contract: referenced commands/paths must exist and remain correct.
- Prefer one canonical “how to run checks locally” set of commands, mirrored by CI.

### Risk Assessment

- **Risk**: Changing wording can temporarily confuse existing contributors who memorized older commands.
- **Mitigation**: Keep changes minimal and add a small “what changed” note in the relevant guide if the recommended commands materially change.

### Rollback Plan

- Documentation-only change: revert doc edits if they introduce new confusion or contradict organizational standards.

### Testing

- Manual doc verification: run the documented commands in a clean environment and confirm they match CI expectations.
