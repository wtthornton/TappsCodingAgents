# Story 1.3: Workflow Orchestration Agent Core

<!-- Source: implementation/cursor/EPIC_01_Foundation.md -->
<!-- Context: Brownfield enhancement to orchestrator + workflow execution -->

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** user running complex workflows,
**I want** the orchestrator to coordinate workflow steps with bounded parallelism, timeouts, and safe state updates,
**so that** multi-agent execution is reliable and does not hang, corrupt state, or require manual babysitting.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Orchestrator can execute at least 2–3 independent tasks in parallel with bounded concurrency (target: 8 max later).
2. Each task execution supports timeout and cancellation propagation.
3. Orchestrator records task lifecycle events into workflow state (`WorkflowState.step_executions`) without breaking existing persistence.
4. Failure handling is deterministic: failures are recorded, and the workflow ends in a clear terminal state (failed/completed).
5. Existing orchestrator CLI commands remain functional (`tapps_agents/agents/orchestrator/agent.py`).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Review current orchestration entry points (AC: 5)
  - [ ] `tapps_agents/agents/orchestrator/agent.py`
  - [ ] `tapps_agents/workflow/executor.py` and Cursor path `tapps_agents/workflow/cursor_executor.py`

- [ ] Task 2: Add bounded parallel execution primitive (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Implement a “run N steps concurrently” helper using `asyncio.TaskGroup` (Python 3.13+)
  - [ ] Ensure deterministic ordering for aggregation / state updates

- [ ] Task 3: Add timeouts + cancellation (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Add per-step timeout configuration (defaults; override via workflow settings)
  - [ ] Ensure cancellation stops downstream waiting loops (e.g., Cursor polling)

- [ ] Task 4: State + event recording (AC: 3, 4)
  - [ ] Ensure `StepExecution` entries are created/updated for parallel tasks
  - [ ] Ensure terminal states are explicit (completed/failed) with error summaries

- [ ] Task 5: Tests (AC: 1–4)
  - [ ] Unit tests for parallel scheduling and cancellation behavior
  - [ ] Regression tests for orchestrator commands

## Dev Notes

### Existing System Context

- Orchestrator agent provides workflow commands in `tapps_agents/agents/orchestrator/agent.py`.
- Workflow execution and step-to-agent mapping is in `tapps_agents/workflow/executor.py`.
- Cursor-mode execution path is in `tapps_agents/workflow/cursor_executor.py` and already creates worktrees per step.

### Integration Approach

- Do not replace the existing executor; extend it with a safe, minimal parallel execution mechanism.
- Keep state updates centralized and deterministic to avoid race conditions.

### Risk Assessment

- **Primary risk**: race conditions updating shared workflow state under concurrency
- **Mitigation**: funnel state mutations through a single coordination point; use task result objects and apply updates in a stable order.

### Rollback Plan

- Disable parallel execution flag; fall back to sequential step execution.

### Testing

- Use `pytest`.
- Prefer deterministic tests with mocked agent execution.
