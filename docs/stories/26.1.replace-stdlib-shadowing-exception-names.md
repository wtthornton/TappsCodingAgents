# Story 26.1: Replace stdlib-shadowing exception names

<!-- Source: implementation/cursor/EPIC_26_Core_Maintainability_Unify_Errors_And_Validation.md -->
<!-- Context: Remove project-defined exception names that shadow Python stdlib built-ins to reduce ambiguity and tooling confusion -->

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** maintainer (and debugger/IDE user),  
**I want** project exception names to never shadow Python built-ins,  
**so that** stack traces, type checks, imports, and tooling behavior are unambiguous and consistent.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. No project-defined exception class shares a name with a Python built-in or stdlib exception (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`, `ValueError`, etc.).
2. Where backwards compatibility is required, explicit compatibility aliases are provided with a documented deprecation note and timeline.
3. All internal imports and references are updated to the new names (no ambiguous shadowing remains anywhere in the repository).
4. Error envelopes (where applicable) preserve the same user-facing semantics (same codes/categories/messages unless explicitly documented as a pure wording cleanup).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Audit existing custom exceptions and usages (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Review `tapps_agents/core/exceptions.py` for names that shadow stdlib/built-ins
  - [ ] Search for imports/usages across `tapps_agents/` and `tests/`
  - [ ] Identify any public API surface where external callers might import these symbols

- [ ] Task 2: Rename exceptions to non-shadowing names (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Choose clear naming scheme (e.g., `AgentFileNotFoundError`, `TappsFileNotFound`, etc.)
  - [ ] Update all references/imports across the codebase
  - [ ] Ensure type checks (`except ...`) and error mappings still behave as intended

- [ ] Task 3: Add compatibility aliases + deprecation notes (if needed) (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Provide explicit aliases with clear comments/docstrings
  - [ ] Add documentation/changelog note for deprecation (scope + timeline)

- [ ] Task 4: Regression coverage (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Add a test/static check preventing reintroduction of shadowing names (or link to Story 26.4)

## Dev Notes

### Existing System Context

- Custom exception types exist in `tapps_agents/core/exceptions.py`.
- Several agents and the base agent may import these exceptions directly.

### Integration Approach

- Prefer a “rename + compatibility alias” approach to minimize disruption.
- Keep error envelope codes/categories stable; treat this as naming/maintainability work, not user-facing feature changes.

### Risk Assessment

- **Risk**: Renames break imports for downstream/third-party code if exceptions are consumed as part of the public API.
- **Mitigation**: Provide explicit aliases + documented deprecation window; add tests enforcing non-shadowing rules.

### Rollback Plan

- Restore previous names (while keeping any centralization work from Stories 26.2–26.4) if breakage is discovered, then reintroduce aliases with clearer migration docs.
