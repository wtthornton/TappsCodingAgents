# Story 36.3: Story Execution Protocol (Task Sequencing & Evidence Capture)

<!-- Source: docs/prd/epic-4-story-driven-development-loop.md -->
<!-- Context: Story-Driven Development Loop - Define the per-task execution order and required evidence capture -->

## Status

**Draft**

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-18

## Story

**As a** TappsCodingAgents autonomous agent,  
**I want** an automated execution protocol for story tasks and evidence capture,  
**so that** work is repeatable, reviewable, and less prone to "missing context" failures without human intervention.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. An automated per-task execution sequence is defined (read → implement → validate → automated review → mark complete).
2. Stories require automatic "File List" and "Change Log" updates during execution (not only at the end).
3. Stories define "minimum evidence" expectations per task (what counts as validation).
4. Story completion requires automated final review checkpoint and recorded outcome (no human approval needed).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Define canonical task execution sequence and rationale (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Provide clear “do this before that” guidance
  - [ ] Define when to stop and request clarification
- [ ] Task 2: Define evidence capture rules (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Define what goes into File List vs Change Log
  - [ ] Define “minimum validation evidence” categories (tests run, static checks, manual verification notes)
- [ ] Task 3: Define story completion / review checkpoint rules (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Define what “Ready for Review” means
  - [ ] Define what must be present before “Done”

## Dev Notes

### Existing System Context

- Existing story documents in `docs/stories/` already contain sections for Change Log, Dev Agent Record, File List, and QA Results; this story standardizes when/how they are updated.
- BMAD progressive review behavior is documented in `.bmad-core/tasks/progressive-code-review.md` (this story defines the general execution protocol that progressive review plugs into).

## Testing

- Documentation-only change; no automated tests required.
- Validation approach: walk through one “sample task” and confirm the protocol yields a complete, auditable record without excessive overhead.
