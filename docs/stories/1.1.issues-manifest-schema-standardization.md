# Story 1.1: Issues Manifest Schema & Standardization

<!-- Source: docs/prd/epic-1-sdlc-quality-engine.md -->
<!-- Context: SDLC Quality Engine Improvements - Foundation -->

## Status

**Deferred** - Duplicate of Story 27.1

## Story

**As a** SDLC workflow system,
**I want** all quality checks to emit issues in a standardized, machine-actionable schema,
**so that** the SDLC can automatically detect, categorize, and remediate issues consistently across all agents and validation steps.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Standardized Issues Manifest schema defined with fields: id, severity, category, evidence, repro, suggested_fix, owner_step
2. Issues Manifest data models implemented with validation
3. All existing agents (reviewer, tester, ops) updated to emit Issues Manifest format
4. Issues Manifest serialization/deserialization utilities created
5. Schema validation passes for all issue types
6. Backward compatibility maintained with existing issue reporting

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Define Issues Manifest Schema (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Design schema structure (id, severity, category, evidence, repro, suggested_fix, owner_step)
  - [ ] Define severity levels (critical/high/medium/low)
  - [ ] Define category taxonomy (security/perf/maintainability/correctness/compliance/ux/etc.)
  - [ ] Document schema specification

- [ ] Task 2: Implement Data Models (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create Issues Manifest data model classes
  - [ ] Add validation logic for all fields
  - [ ] Add type checking and constraints
  - [ ] Create factory methods for common issue types

- [ ] Task 3: Create Serialization Utilities (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Implement JSON serialization/deserialization
  - [ ] Add YAML support for human-readable format
  - [ ] Create validation utilities
  - [ ] Add schema versioning support

- [ ] Task 4: Update Existing Agents (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Update reviewer agent to emit Issues Manifest format
  - [ ] Update tester agent to emit Issues Manifest format
  - [ ] Update ops agent to emit Issues Manifest format
  - [ ] Add migration utilities for existing issue formats

- [ ] Task 5: Testing & Validation (AC: 5, 6)
  - [ ] Unit tests for schema validation
  - [ ] Integration tests for agent migration
  - [ ] Backward compatibility tests
  - [ ] Schema validation test suite

## Dev Notes

**Integration Points:**
- Existing agents: `tapps_agents/agents/reviewer/`, `tapps_agents/agents/tester/`, `tapps_agents/agents/ops/`
- Workflow executor: `tapps_agents/workflow/executor.py`
- Project profile system: `tapps_agents/core/project_profile.py`

**Technology Stack:**
- Python 3.13+
- Pydantic for data models (if used in project)
- Existing serialization patterns in codebase

**Key Constraints:**
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing issue reporting
- Schema must be extensible for future categories/severities
- Serialization must be efficient for large issue sets

**Testing Standards:**
- Test file location: `tests/unit/test_issues_manifest.py`
- Test existing agent integration points
- Validate schema with real-world issue examples
