# Story 12.7: Testing and Documentation

<!-- Source: implementation/EPIC_12_State_Persistence_and_Resume.md -->

## Status

**Draft**

## Story

**As a** developer or user,
**I want** comprehensive tests and documentation for the state persistence and resume system,
**so that** I can confidently use the feature, understand how it works, and troubleshoot issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Comprehensive unit tests created for all state persistence components (>80% coverage)
2. Integration tests created for resume capability
3. End-to-end tests created for state recovery and versioning
4. Test fixtures created for state simulation and corruption scenarios
5. Comprehensive user documentation written (state management, resume, troubleshooting)
6. Developer documentation written (architecture, API reference, state format)

## Dev Notes

### Technical Context

- **Integration Points:**
  - `tapps_agents/workflow/workflow_state.py` - State management
  - `tapps_agents/workflow/executor.py` - Workflow execution
  - `.tapps-agents/workflow-state/` - State storage directory
  - Test framework (pytest)

- **Testing Strategy:**
  - Unit tests: Test individual components in isolation
  - Integration tests: Test component interactions
  - End-to-end tests: Test complete workflows with persistence
  - Fixtures: Reusable test data and mocks

- **Documentation Structure:**
  - User docs: Focus on usage, configuration, troubleshooting
  - Developer docs: Focus on architecture, API, implementation details
  - Examples: Real-world use cases and scenarios

### Dependencies

- **Depends on:** All other EPIC_12 stories (12.1-12.6)
- **Enables:** Production readiness and user adoption

### Architecture Considerations

- Tests should be fast and reliable
- Test fixtures should be reusable and maintainable
- Documentation should be clear and comprehensive
- Examples should be realistic and helpful

### Testing Considerations

- Test normal operation (happy path)
- Test error conditions (corruption, missing files, invalid formats)
- Test edge cases (empty state, large state, concurrent access)
- Test backward compatibility (old state formats)
- Test performance (large state files, many checkpoints)
