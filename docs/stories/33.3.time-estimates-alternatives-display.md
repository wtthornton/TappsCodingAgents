# Story 33.3: Time Estimates & Alternatives Display

<!-- Source: implementation/EPIC_05_Workflow_Recommendation_Engine_Enhancement.md -->

## Status

**Ready for Review**

## Story

**As a** framework user,
**I want** to see time estimates and alternative workflows when getting recommendations,
**so that** I can make informed decisions about which workflow to use.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Time estimates are calculated for recommended workflows
2. Alternative workflow options are displayed
3. Comparison of workflows is shown (time, complexity, use cases)
4. Output is formatted for readability
5. Estimates are clearly labeled as approximate
6. Alternatives include brief descriptions

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Calculate time estimates (AC: 1, 5)
  - [x] Define estimation algorithm (heuristic based on track)
  - [x] Calculate based on workflow complexity
  - [x] Label estimates as approximate
  - [x] Handle edge cases

- [x] Task 2: Get alternatives (AC: 2)
  - [x] Identify alternative workflows
  - [x] Get alternative recommendations
  - [x] Filter relevant alternatives (show top 5)

- [x] Task 3: Create comparison (AC: 3)
  - [x] Compare workflows by time (via time estimates)
  - [x] Compare by complexity (via track)
  - [x] Compare by use cases (via workflow descriptions)
  - [x] Format comparison display

- [x] Task 4: Format output (AC: 4, 6)
  - [x] Format time estimates clearly
  - [x] Format alternatives with descriptions
  - [x] Format comparison display
  - [x] Ensure readability

## Dev Notes

### Existing System Context

- WorkflowRecommender provides alternatives
- Workflow definitions exist
- CLI output formatting patterns
- Time estimation may need implementation

### Integration Approach

- Extend recommender with time estimation
- Use existing alternative workflow logic
- Format output in CLI command
- Follow output formatting patterns

### Risk Assessment

- **Primary risk**: Time estimates may be inaccurate
  - **Mitigation**: Clearly label as approximate, based on historical data

### Rollback Plan

- Remove time estimates
- Keep alternatives display
- No breaking changes

### Testing

- Test time estimation
- Test alternatives display
- Test comparison formatting
- Test output readability

## Change Log

| Date       | Version | Description                     | Author      |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 2025-01-XX | 0.1     | Initial draft for Epic 33.3     | bmad-master |

## Dev Agent Record

**Implementation Complete:**
- Implemented `_estimate_time()` function with heuristic based on workflow track:
  - Quick Flow: 5-15 minutes
  - BMad Method: 15-30 minutes
  - Enterprise: 30-60 minutes
- Time estimates clearly labeled as approximate
- Alternative workflows displayed (top 5) with list format
- Comparison shown through time estimates and track information
- Output formatted for readability with clear sections

**Files Modified:**
- `tapps_agents/cli/commands/top_level.py` - Added time estimation and alternatives display

## QA Results

_TBD_
