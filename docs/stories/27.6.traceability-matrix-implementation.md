# Story 27.6: Traceability Matrix Implementation

<!-- Source: docs/prd/epic-1-sdlc-quality-engine.md -->
<!-- Context: SDLC Quality Engine Improvements - Completeness Tracking -->

## Status

**Draft** - Not Implemented

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-XX

**Implementation Notes:**
- No traceability matrix implementation found in codebase
- No requirements → stories → validations mapping
- No acceptance criterion coverage tracking
- No machine-checkable completeness verification

## Story

**As a** SDLC workflow system,
**I want** a traceability matrix that maps requirements → stories → validations,
**so that** the SDLC can verify functional completeness and ensure all acceptance criteria are covered by appropriate verification.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Lightweight traceability matrix artifact structure created
2. Requirements → stories → validations mapping implemented
3. Acceptance criterion coverage tracking implemented
4. Machine-checkable completeness verification created
5. Traceability matrix correctly maps relationships
6. Coverage tracking works accurately
7. Completeness verification identifies gaps

## Dev Notes

**Integration Points:**
- Workflow executor: `tapps_agents/workflow/executor.py`
- Story tracking: Existing story system
- Requirements: PRD/epic system
- Validation system: Story 27.3 output
- Issues Manifest: Story 27.1 output

**Technology Stack:**
- Python 3.13+
- Existing story/requirement tracking
- Data structures for relationship mapping

**Key Constraints:**
- Traceability matrix must be lightweight and efficient
- Mapping must be maintainable and clear
- Completeness verification must be fast
- Must support incremental updates

**Testing Standards:**
- Test file location: `tests/unit/test_traceability.py`
- Test mapping accuracy
- Test coverage calculation
- Test completeness verification
- Integration tests with workflow
