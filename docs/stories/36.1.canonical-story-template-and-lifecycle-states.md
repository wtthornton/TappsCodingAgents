# Story 36.1: Canonical Story Template & Autonomous Lifecycle States

<!-- Source: docs/prd/epic-4-story-driven-development-loop.md -->
<!-- Context: Autonomous Story-Driven Development Loop - Canonical story format and automated lifecycle state model -->

## Status

**Draft**

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-18

## Story

**As a** TappsCodingAgents autonomous agent,  
**I want** a canonical story template and automated lifecycle state transitions,  
**so that** all work is planned, executed, reviewed, and audited consistently without human intervention.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A canonical story template is defined and aligned to the BMAD story template sections (Status, Story, Acceptance Criteria, Tasks/Subtasks, Dev Notes, Testing, Change Log, Dev Agent Record, QA Results).
2. Story lifecycle states are defined and unambiguous (Draft, Auto-Approved, In Progress, Ready for Review, Done).
3. **Automated state transition rules are defined** (quality gates trigger transitions, no human approval required).
4. The template includes an explicit place to record "evidence" (e.g., file list, change log, QA results) so the story is auditable without additional context.
5. A single "golden story" example is documented that demonstrates the template end-to-end with automated transitions (from Draft through Done).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Define story template sections and required fields (AC: 1, 4)
  - [ ] Align to `.bmad-core/templates/story-tmpl.yaml` section set
  - [ ] Ensure the template matches existing `docs/stories/` conventions
  - [ ] Define minimum “audit trail” expectations
- [ ] Task 2: Define autonomous lifecycle state definitions and automated transitions (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Define entry/exit criteria per state
  - [ ] Define automated quality gate triggers for each transition (e.g., Draft → Auto-Approved when risk assessment passes)
  - [ ] Define required evidence for transitions (e.g., review decision recorded before Done)
  - [ ] Document how state transitions happen automatically (no human approval required)
- [ ] Task 3: Document a “golden story” example (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Provide a realistic example with representative acceptance criteria and tasks
  - [ ] Include examples for change log, file list, and QA results

## Dev Notes

### Existing System Context

- Existing story format examples live in `docs/stories/` (e.g., completed stories like `docs/stories/9.1.natural-language-parser-foundation.md` and `docs/stories/28.5.governance-safety-layer.md`).
- The authoritative BMAD story section definitions and lifecycle states are in `.bmad-core/templates/story-tmpl.yaml`.
- This story is documentation/process only; it should not require implementation changes to runtime code.

## Testing

- Documentation-only change; no automated tests required.
- Validation approach: ensure the new template is usable by applying it to a “golden story” and confirming all sections are practical and non-duplicative.
