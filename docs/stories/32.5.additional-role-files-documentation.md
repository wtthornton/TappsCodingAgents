# Story 32.5: Additional Role Files & Documentation

## Status

**Ready for Review**

## Story

2. Role file is created for documenter agent
3. Role file is created for planner agent
4. Role file is created for remaining built-in agents (if any)
5. Role file format and creation process is documented
6. Examples of role customization are provided
