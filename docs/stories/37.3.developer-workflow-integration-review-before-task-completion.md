# Story 37.3: Developer Workflow Integration (Review Before Task Completion)

<!-- Source: docs/prd/epic-5-progressive-task-level-review.md -->
<!-- Context: Progressive Task-Level Review - Define when reviews occur and how they affect task completion -->

## Status

**✅ Implemented**

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-18

## Story

**As a** TappsCodingAgents autonomous agent executing story tasks,  
**I want** automated progressive reviews to be a standard step before marking a task complete,  
**so that** severe issues are caught early and the final QA pass is faster and more reliable without human intervention.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The automated workflow rule is defined: "No task is marked complete without an automated progressive review decision."
2. A BLOCK decision automatically halts progress until resolved (or automatically waived based on configured risk acceptance policies).
3. A CONCERNS decision can be automatically resolved immediately or deferred with explicit documentation and rationale.
4. The story's task list automatically shows the review decision status per task (so progress is visible and auditable).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Define “review before completion” workflow rule and rationale (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Define minimal required review step per task
  - [ ] Define where the decision is recorded
- [ ] Task 2: Define BLOCK handling protocol (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Define resolution expectations
  - [ ] Define waiver conditions and required documentation
- [ ] Task 3: Define CONCERNS handling protocol (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Define fix-now vs defer rules
  - [ ] Define how deferred concerns are tracked for final QA
- [ ] Task 4: Define per-task visibility conventions (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Define how task list reflects review state (e.g., checklist annotation)

## Dev Notes

### Existing System Context

- Progressive review intent and validation exist in `.bmad-core/tasks/progressive-code-review.md` and `.bmad-core/PROGRESSIVE_REVIEW_VALIDATION.md`.
- This story assumes the Story-Driven Development Loop conventions exist (see Epic 4) so “task” has a consistent meaning and place to record decisions.

## Testing

- Documentation-only change; no automated tests required.
- Validation approach: apply the protocol to a sample story with 3–5 tasks and confirm the workflow makes it hard to “skip review.”
