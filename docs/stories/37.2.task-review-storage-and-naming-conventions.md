# Story 37.2: Task Review Storage and Naming Conventions

<!-- Source: docs/prd/epic-5-progressive-task-level-review.md -->
<!-- Context: Progressive Task-Level Review - Define where progressive reviews live and how they are referenced -->

## Status

**✅ Implemented**

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-18

## Story

**As a** TappsCodingAgents autonomous agent,  
**I want** consistent storage and naming conventions for progressive task reviews,  
**so that** automated task-level decisions are easy to find, stable over time, and clearly linked to the story and task.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A canonical storage location convention is defined for progressive reviews (where they live in the repo).
2. Naming convention is defined and uniquely identifies the story and the task being reviewed.
3. Each progressive review record is referenced from the story (so the story is the system of record).
4. Retention expectations are defined (what stays long-term vs what can be pruned), without losing auditability.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Define storage location and directory conventions (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Decide whether reviews live alongside stories or in a dedicated subdirectory
  - [ ] Ensure conventions are compatible with existing repo structure
- [ ] Task 2: Define naming conventions (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Define required naming fields (story id, task id, decision)
  - [ ] Define how to handle re-reviews (versioning)
- [ ] Task 3: Define story-linking conventions (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Define how the story references per-task reviews (links or inline summary)
- [ ] Task 4: Define retention policy (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Define minimum required retention for audit trails
  - [ ] Define how/when pruning can occur safely

## Dev Notes

### Existing System Context

- BMAD progressive review output is designed to be validated and accumulated; see `.bmad-core/PROGRESSIVE_REVIEW_VALIDATION.md`.
- Existing repo practice: stories already contain a “Change Log” and “File List”; progressive review records should augment (not replace) these.

## Testing

- Documentation-only change; no automated tests required.
- Validation approach: confirm that given a story id and task id, the corresponding review record can be found quickly and deterministically.
